I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.

This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a universal automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.

And so... I created autoSmry!

## autoSmry

**[autoSmry](../../project/autosmry/)** is a lightweight, modern-looking, automatic text summarizer built entirely in R and R Shiny.

## Test 1: Jurassic World Movie

As a test for autoSmry, I went with the text of something that I can comfortably recall and assess... the plot of the 2015 movie reboot, **[Jurassic World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World#Plot)** `r emo::ji("thumbsup")`.

### Test results

Here are the results of autoSmry after applying it to the plot of Jurassic World:

That's pretty cool! The Indominus Rex is indeed the main villain of the movie and is the cause of all the action to our protagonists!

## Test 2: Rainbow Six Novel

For the second test, I went with the plot summary to the novel **[Rainbow Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Six_(novel)#Plot_summary)** by Tom Clancy.

That's pretty good too!

## Test 3: Blog post from Ask A Manager

I enjoy reading Ask A Manager for its great practical, everyday working advice, and also for some great entertainment too! Here's the auto summary from a post titled **[CEOâ€™s wife ruined my job prospects](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/07/ceos-wife-ruined-my-job-prospects.html)**:

### Test results

A reader writes:

<br>

Response:

</center>
<br>

The reader summary started off very well, but the summary never got into what happened on the train, which was critical to understanding what happened. The response summary however, I thought was pretty good! (I would recommend that you read the full original text from Ask A Manager if you haven't yet).

## Test 4: Another blog post from Ask a Manager

This post is titled **[when writing to a hiring manager, should I mention a shared hobby?](http://www.askamanager.org/2018/05/when-writing-to-a-hiring-manager-should-i-mention-a-shared-hobby.html).

### Test results:

I was really impressed with this one. I can't really find any faults with these summaries.

## Test 5: A bunch of movies

I'm going to use the function directly to produce one sentence summaries for a bunch of movies.

```{r setup, include = F}
source("E:/Projects/text.summarizer/text.summary.function.udpipe.nsent.R")
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
```

First, a small bit of code to pull the top 10 highest grossing films from Wikipedia:
```{r movies, echo = T, message = F}
# Get top 10 movies
movie.url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_films"

movie.data <- read_html(movie.url) %>%
        html_node("table") %>%
        html_table() %>%
        head(10)

# Drop unneeded data
movie.data.clean <- movie.data %>%
        select(Rank, Title)

# Load movie plots
plot.data <- read_dir("E:/Projects/Website/data/movie.plots") %>%
        group_by(document) %>%
        summarize(Plot = paste(content, collapse = " ") %>%
                          replace_non_ascii())

# Combine data
movie.plot.data <- cbind(movie.data.clean, plot.data) %>%
        select(-document)
```

And now, to run the `auto_smry` function for all 10 movie plots:

```{r movie.autosmry, echo = T, message = F}
# Run auto_smry for all plot lines
movie.plot.autosmry <- movie.plot.data %>%
        mutate(autoSmry = map(.$Plot, auto_smry, 1)) %>%
        select(-Plot)

```

### Test results

Gives us the following table:

```{r movie.show, echo = F, message = F}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

kable(movie.plot.autosmry, "html") %>%
        kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"),
                      font_size = 10)

```

Reducing down to only 1 sentence makes it much harder to produce a sensible summary. The worst summary in my opinion is the one produced for Black Panther, however, for the other movies, it doesn't appear to be too bad.

## Conclusion

Yes... I am biased... but I really do think the results are fairly good! It can certainly serve as a fast initial first screen on things that I would otherwise just not read at all. Feel free to try it out yourself and let me know if you have any thoughts! **[(It is located in the Projects section)](../../project/autoSmry/)**

### My plans

I developed this tool as a quick and easy way for me to obtain summaries of text without worrying about if my data will be logged or captured in some way. I plan on keeping it free for use for everyone for as long as I am able to.
