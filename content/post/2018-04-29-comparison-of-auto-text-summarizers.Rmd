I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.

This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.

And so... I created autoSmry!

## autoSmry

**[autoSmry](../../project/autosmry/)** is a lightweight, modern-looking, extractive, automatic text summarizer built entirely in R and R Shiny.

## Test 1: Jurassic World Movie

As a test for autoSmry, I went with the text of something that I can comfortably recall and assess... the plot of the 2015 movie reboot, **[Jurassic World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World#Plot)** `r emo::ji("thumbsup")`.

### Test results

Here are the results of autoSmry after applying it to the plot of Jurassic World:

That's pretty cool! The Indominus Rex is indeed the main villain of the movie and is the cause of all the action to our protagonists!

## Test 2: Rainbow Six Novel

For the second test, I went with the plot summary to the novel **[Rainbow Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Six_(novel)#Plot_summary)** by Tom Clancy.

That's not bad either!

## Test 3: Blog post from Ask A Manager

I enjoy reading Ask A Manager for its great practical, everyday working advice, and also for some great entertainment too! Here's the auto summary from a post titled **[company wants references from “coworkers you didn’t get along with"](http://www.askamanager.org/2016/10/company-wants-references-from-coworkers-you-didnt-get-along-with.html)**:

A reader writes:

Response:

</center>

These two summaries really surprised me on how well it was done! (But even still, I would recommend that you read the full original text from Ask A Manager if you haven't yet).

## Test 4:

I'm going to use the function directly to produce one sentence summaries for a bunch of movies:

```{r setup, include = F}
source("E:/Projects/text.summarizer/text.summary.function.udpipe.R")
```

## Conclusion

Yes... I am biased... but I really do think the results are fairly good! It can certainly serve as a fast initial first screen on things that I would otherwise just not read at all. Feel free to try it out yourself and let me know if you have any thoughts! **[(It is located in the Projects section)](../../project/autoSmry/)**
