I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.

This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.

Let's first see what is available on the internet.

## Survey of current auto text summarizers

A quick Google search for "auto text summarizer" yields the following (as of Apr. 29, 2018):

## Text for auto summary test

As a test of the auto text summary capabilities of the top 3 results, I'm going to use a random article from Wikipedia. The article I found is on the **[Subfossil lemur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfossil_lemur)**.

### Test results

**1. Automatic Text Summarizer**

**My comments:**

The summary produced begins with "They" and therefore makes it difficult to determine what the article is about. It also reads like a machine and doesn't flow very well.

I'm also not crazy about the visuals. In my opinion, not a very great summary.

**2. Text Summarizer**

**My comments:**

My initial reaction is that this one starts with "Subfossil lemurs" and therefore makes it clear what the article is about. It also flows much better than the first auto summary. But then I realized, this summarizer simply just took the 5 sentences from the original article and so I'm unsure if it makes does anything more sophisticated than that.

**3. Free Summarizer**

**My comments:**

The third summarizer appears to be the best of the 3. It starts off with mentioning "Subfossil lemurs" and proceeds to give a few relevant facts.
