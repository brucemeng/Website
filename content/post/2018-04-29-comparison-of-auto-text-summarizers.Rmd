I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.

This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.

And so... I created autosmry!

## autosmry

**[autosmry](../../project/autosmry/)** is a lightweight modern looking extractive text summarizer built entirely in R and R Shiny.

## Text for auto summary test

As a test for autosmry, I went with the text of something that I can comfortably recall and assess... the plot of the 2015 movie reboot, **[Jurassic World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World#Plot)** `r emo::ji("thumbsup")`.
