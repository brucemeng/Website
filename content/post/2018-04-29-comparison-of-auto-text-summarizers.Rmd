I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.

This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.
