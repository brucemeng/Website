I received some interesting data on branch locations from my counterpart on the Personal & Commercial Banking Strategic Business Analysis team. Now, the actual data I received is confidential data that the BMO Market Analytics team put together so I won't be showing that here, but I found an open source intel option from [Payments Canada](https://www.payments.ca/our-directories/financial-institutions-branch-directory) that I can use instead.

# Data

The data set itself looks to be a very comprehensive list of all bank branches from what looks like every bank that operates in Canada... so lots of bonus points there as a data source. Unfortunately, the data is only available as a PDF so getting it into a usable format will either be very manual (e.g. cutting/pasting in Excel), or quite a bit of code will be dedicated to processing the data.

Here's a snapshot of the data from the PDF:

![Payments Canada - Financial Institutions Branch Directory Sample Data](/img/fib.sample.data.png)

Notwithstanding that the data file is a PDF, it is also not exactly the most machine readable data. The bulk of this post will be on getting this data into a clean, machine readable format.

First step is loading this PDF into R:

```{r data.pdf}
library(textreadr)

branch.pdf <- read_pdf("../../data/branches/mbrbnksn_2.pdf")
head(branch.pdf, 20) %>% knitr::kable()
```

\newline
I like the `read_pdf` function from the package `textreadr` rather than the main `pdftools` package because it places the text in a data frame. The next step would be to isolate the routing numbers:

```{r data.iso}
branches.route <- str_extract(branch.pdf$text, "[0-9]{9}") %>%
                        data.frame(Routing = .)
branches.clean <- cbind(branch.pdf, branches.route)

head(branches.clean, 20) %>% knitr::kable()
```

\newline
From the routing numbers, we can extract the bank identification numbers:

```{r data.bank}
branches.clean$Bank.nbr <- substr(branches.clean$Routing, 1, 4)
head(branches.clean, 20) %>% knitr::kable()
```

\newline
And we can now identify the banks that each branch belongs to. To make it easier to recognize the banks, I created a manual mapping of bank numbers to bank names:

```{r data.banknames, warning = F, message = F}
bank.names <- data.frame(Bank.nbr = c("0001", "0010", "0003", "0002", "0004"),
                         Bank.name = c("BMO", "CIBC", "RBC", "BNS", "TD"))

bank.branches <- left_join(branches.clean, bank.names)

bank.branches[3161:3165,] %>% knitr::kable()
```

\newline
And now, the final bit of text extraction, we can pull out the postal codes of the branches to get their locations:

```{r data.postal, warning = F, message = F}
bank.branches$Postal <- str_extract(bank.branches$text, 
                               "[A-Z][0-9][A-Z][:space:][0-9][A-z][0-9]")

head(bank.branches, 20) %>% knitr::kable()
```

\newline
That's pretty much it in terms of cleaning the data to a point where we can then get the longitude/latitudes out of this data set. Check out the corresponding map I made in the [Projects](https://www.brucemeng.ca/project/map-branch/) section.
