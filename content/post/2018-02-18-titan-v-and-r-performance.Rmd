I have been using an AMD/ATI Radeon 7970 3GB GPU since it first came out in 2012 and for a number of reasons I have finally decided it was time for an upgrade! (One of the reasons is that TensorFlow is only in CUDA). 

# Goodbye ol'faithful 7970

I'm going to miss this card. It's held up very well over the years, and the Arctic Accelero cooler I put on top of it was whisper quiet!

# Hello TITAN V

I got the TITAN V as the replacement to the 7970. Here's some unboxing pics I took:

The TITAN V was released a few months ago and there are several excellent reviews out about the card already. I highly recommend **[Anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12170/nvidia-titan-v-preview-titanomachy)**.

```{r specs, echo = F, fig.cap = "Specs table courtesy of Anandtech", message = F}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)

# Get data
table.url <- "https://www.anandtech.com/show/12170/nvidia-titan-v-preview-titanomachy"

table.data <- read_html(table.url) %>%
        html_node("table") %>%
        html_table(fill = T) %>%
        select(num_range("X", 1:5))

table.data.names <- table.data[2,]

table.data <- table.data %>%
        slice(-(1:2))

names(table.data) <- table.data.names

# Display data
kable(table.data, "html") %>%
        kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"),
                      font_size = 10) %>%
        add_header_above(c("Specification Comparison" = 5))

```

# Benchmarks

This is a run against the *Quora Question Pairs* Kaggle competition dataset, as found as an example on the Keras for R website:

>The dataset first appeared in the Kaggle competition Quora Question Pairs. The dataset consists of ~400k pairs of questions and a column indicating if the question pair is duplicated.
