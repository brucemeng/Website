I have been using an AMD/ATI Radeon 7970 3GB GPU since it first came out in 2012 and for a number of reasons I have finally decided it was time for an upgrade! (One of the reasons is that TensorFlow is only in CUDA). 

# Goodbye ol'faithful 7970

I'm going to miss this card. It's held up very well over the years, and the Arctic Accelero cooler I put on top of it made the card whisper quiet in addition to cooling it better by about 20C!

# Hello TITAN V

I got the TITAN V as the replacement to the 7970. Here's some unboxing pics I took:

The TITAN V was released a few months ago and there are already several excellent reviews out about the card already. I highly recommend **[Anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12170/nvidia-titan-v-preview-titanomachy)**.

```{r specs, echo = F, fig.cap = "Specs table courtesy of Anandtech", message = F}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)

# Get data
table.url <- "https://www.anandtech.com/show/12170/nvidia-titan-v-preview-titanomachy"

table.data <- read_html(table.url) %>%
        html_node("table") %>%
        html_table(fill = T) %>%
        select(num_range("X", 1:5))

table.data.names <- table.data[2,]

table.data <- table.data %>%
        slice(-(1:2))

names(table.data) <- table.data.names

# Display data
kable(table.data, "html") %>%
        kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"),
                      font_size = 10) %>%
        add_header_above(c("Specification Comparison" = 5))

```

# Benchmarks

## R/Keras - CNN/LSTM Model

This is a run against the *IMDb sentiment classification task* dataset, as found as an example on the [Keras RStudio website](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/imdb_cnn_lstm.html).

The model itself consists of a convolutional network layer, followed by a LSTM layer and 1 epoch contains 25,000 samples for training.

Training time with an Intel i7 980x CPU at 3.34 GHz:

It's taking about 25s to complete 1 epoch on the Intel CPU.


Training time with TITAN V:

## R/Keras - MLP Model

A multilayer perceptron model trained on Reuters newswire data for a topic classification task, found [here](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/reuters_mlp.html).

## Other - Mining Garlicoins (cryptocurrency)

**[Garlicoin](https://garlicoin.io/)** is a new cryptocurrency and I've been mining it for fun on my 7970 GPU, and now will do some mining (or baking rather) on my new TITAN V.

Speed comparison on 7970:

Speed comparison on TITAN V:

The 7970 was able to mine with a hashrate of approx. 310Kh/s, while the TITAN V was able to mine with a hashrate of approx. xxxKh/s. That's a yyy% improvement!
