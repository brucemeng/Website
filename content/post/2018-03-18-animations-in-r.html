<p>When I was in school, I always found that the blackboard was the best teaching tool (as opposed to say a pre-prepared static slide in PowerPoint). As a student, I found it really helpful to see a concept get built up from nothing, and accordingly when I was a teaching assistant in economics, I also preferred using the blackboard to build up concepts together with my students (I also found it more fun as it was now a collaborative experience). Now in the business world, developing concepts is still as important as when I was in school, and the closest computer-presentation equivalent to the blackboard is… the animation!</p>
<p>I’ve been trying two methods with animations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>gganimate</code> &amp; <code>tweenr</code></li>
<li><code>plotly</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s build a quick demo of each!</p>
<div id="gganimate-with-tweenr" class="section level1">
<h1><code>gganimate</code> with <code>tweenr</code></h1>
<p>First up, is a solution that’s fully self-contained within the ggplot2 universe: the package <code>gganimate</code>.</p>
</div>
