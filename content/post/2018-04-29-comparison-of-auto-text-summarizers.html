<p>I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.</p>
<p>This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.</p>
<p>Let’s first see what is available on the internet.</p>

<h2>Survey of current auto text summarizers</h2>
<p>A quick Google search for “auto text summarizer” yields the following (as of Apr. 29, 2018):</p>

<h2>Text for auto summary test</h2>
<p>As a test of the auto text summary capabilities of the top 3 results, I’m going to use a random article from Wikipedia. The article I found is on the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfossil_lemur">Subfossil lemur</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>Test results</h2>
<p><strong>1. Automatic Text Summarizer</strong></p>

<p><br> <strong>My comments:</strong></p>
<p>The summary produced begins with “They” and therefore makes it difficult to determine what the article is about. It also reads like a machine and doesn’t flow very well.</p>
<p>I’m also not crazy about the visuals. In my opinion, not a very great summary.</p>
<p><br> <strong>2. Text Summarizer</strong></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p><br> <strong>My comments:</strong></p>
<p>This one starts with “Subfossil lemurs” and therefore makes it clear what the article is about. It also flows much better than the first auto summary. Overall, a better result than the first one.</p>
<p><br> <strong>3. Free Summarizer</strong></p>

<p><br> <strong>My comments:</strong></p>
<p>The third summarizer also starts with the proper topic sentence “Subfossil lemurs…”. The next few factual sentences are slightly different than the second summarizer, but I wouldn’t say it is better or worse.</p>
