<p>I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.</p>
<p>This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.</p>
<p>Let’s first see what is available on the internet.</p>

<p>A quick Google search for “auto text summarizer” yields the following (as of Apr. 29, 2018):</p>

<h2>Text for auto summary test</h2>
<p>As a test of the auto text summary capabilities of the top 3 results, I’m going to use a random article from Wikipedia. The article I found is <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfossil_lemur">Subfossil lemur</a></strong>.</p>
