<p>I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.</p>
<p>This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a universal automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.</p>
<p>And so‚Ä¶ I created autoSmry!</p>
<div id="autosmry" class="section level2">
<h2>autoSmry</h2>
<p><strong><a href="../../project/autosmry/">autoSmry</a></strong> is a lightweight, modern-looking, automatic text summarizer built entirely in R and R Shiny.</p>

<div id="test-1-jurassic-world-movie" class="section level2">
<h2>Test 1: Jurassic World Movie</h2>
<p>As a test for autoSmry, I went with the text of something that I can comfortably recall and assess‚Ä¶ the plot of the 2015 movie reboot, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World#Plot">Jurassic World</a></strong> üëç.</p>

<h3>Test results</h3>
<p>Here are the results of autoSmry after applying it to the plot of Jurassic World:</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>That‚Äôs pretty cool! The Indominus Rex is indeed the main villain of the movie and is the cause of all the action to our protagonists!</p>

<div id="test-2-rainbow-six-novel" class="section level2">
<h2>Test 2: Rainbow Six Novel</h2>
<p>For the second test, I went with the plot summary to the novel <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Six_(novel)#Plot_summary">Rainbow Six</a></strong> by Tom Clancy.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs pretty good too!</p>

<p>I enjoy reading Ask A Manager for its great practical, everyday working advice, and also for some great entertainment too!

<p>I thought this was okay. The reader summary could‚Äôve been better if it included a sentence on what that hobby was, but the response summary was pretty spot on in my opinion.</p>

<h2>Test 4: The about page from <strong><a href="https://princeoftravel.com/about">Prince of Travel</a></strong>.</h2>
<p>A friend of mine recently started a blog on how to travel the world in style, all on rewards and points. I ran autoSmry on his <strong><a href="https://princeoftravel.com/about">About | Prince of Travel</a></strong> page. Here are the results.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt really find any faults on this summary. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the best one yet. (I‚Äôd also recommend giving his site a look if you are looking to travel somewhere!).</p>

<div id="test-5-a-bunch-of-movies" class="section level2">
<h2>Test 5: A bunch of movies</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm going to use the function directly to produce one sentence summaries for a bunch of movies.</p>
<p>First, a small bit of code to pull the top 10 highest grossing films from Wikipedia:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get top 10 movies
movie.url &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_films&quot;

movie.data &lt;- read_html(movie.url) %&gt;%
        html_node(&quot;table&quot;) %&gt;%
        html_table() %&gt;%
        head(10)

# Drop unneeded data
movie.data.clean &lt;- movie.data %&gt;%
        select(Rank, Title)

# Load movie plots
plot.data &lt;- read_dir(&quot;E:/Projects/Website/data/movie.plots&quot;) %&gt;%
        group_by(document) %&gt;%
        summarize(Plot = paste(content, collapse = &quot; &quot;) %&gt;%
                          replace_non_ascii())

# Combine data
movie.plot.data &lt;- cbind(movie.data.clean, plot.data) %&gt;%
        select(-document)</code></pre>
<p>And now, to run the <code>auto_smry</code> function for all 10 movie plots:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Run auto_smry for all plot lines
movie.plot.autosmry &lt;- movie.plot.data %&gt;%
        mutate(autoSmry = map(.$Plot, auto_smry, 1)) %&gt;%
        select(-Plot)</code></pre>
<div id="test-results-4" class="section level3">

<p>Reducing down to only 1 sentence makes it much harder to produce a sensible summary. The worst summary in my opinion is the one produced for Black Panther, however, for the other movies, it doesn‚Äôt appear to be too bad.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes‚Ä¶ I am biased‚Ä¶ but I really do think the results are fairly good! It can certainly serve as a fast initial first screen on things that I would otherwise just not read at all.

<h3>My plans</h3>
<p>I developed this tool as a quick and easy way for me to obtain summaries of text without worrying about if my data will be logged or captured in some way. I plan on keeping it free for use for everyone for as long as I am able to.</p>
