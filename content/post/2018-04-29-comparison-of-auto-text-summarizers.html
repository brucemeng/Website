<p>I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.</p>
<p>This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.</p>
<p>And so‚Ä¶ I created autosmry!</p>

<h2>autosmry</h2>
<p><strong><a href="../../project/autosmry/">autosmry</a></strong> is a lightweight modern looking extractive automatic text summarizer built entirely in R and R Shiny.</p>

<h2>Test 1: Jurassic World Movie</h2>
<p>As a test for autosmry, I went with the text of something that I can comfortably recall and assess‚Ä¶ the plot of the 2015 movie reboot, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World#Plot">Jurassic World</a></strong> üëç.</p>

<h3>Test results</h3>
<p>Here are the results of autosmry after applying it to the plot of Jurassic World:</p>

<p>That‚Äôs pretty cool! The Indominus Rex is indeed the main villain of the movie and is the cause of all the action to our protagonists!</p>

<div id="test-2-rainbow-six-novel" class="section level2">
<h2>Test 2: Rainbow Six Novel</h2>
<p>For the second test, I went with a longer piece of text, the plot summary to the novel <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Six_(novel)#Plot_summary">Rainbow Six</a></strong> by Tom Clancy.</p>

<h3>Test results</h3>

<p>That‚Äôs not bad either!</p>

<h2>Test 3: Blog post from Ask A Manager</h2>
<p>I enjoy reading Ask A Manager for its great practical, everyday working advice, and also for some great entertainment too! Here‚Äôs a summary from a post titled <strong><a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2016/10/company-wants-references-from-coworkers-you-didnt-get-along-with.html">company wants references from ‚Äúcoworkers you didn‚Äôt get along with‚Äù</a></strong>:</p>
<p>A reader writes:</p>

<p>Response:</p>

<p>These two summaries are probably the best summary out of them all!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes‚Ä¶ I am biased‚Ä¶ but I really do think the results are fairly good! It can certainly serve as a fast initial first screen on things that I would otherwise just not read at all. Feel free to try it out yourself and let me know if you have any thoughts! <strong><a href="../../project/autosmry/">(It is located in the Projects section)</a></strong></p>
