<p>I started off my text analytics journey with sentiment analysis because I just thought it was so very cool that a machine can detect positivity or negativity from humans! I ended up creating a report which summarized review-like reports after training and applying a sentiment algorithm to gauge the amount of positivity or negativity from the reviewers. I found that as a by product, by focusing on particularly positive or particularly negative comments, my created report also produced a fairly decent summary.</p>
<p>This however only works on reviews. I wanted to look into a generic automatic text summarizer that will work on factual documents as well as more sentiment charged articles.</p>
<p>And so‚Ä¶ I created autosmry!</p>

<h2>Test 1: Jurassic World Movie</h2>
<p>As a test for autosmry, I went with the text of something that I can comfortably recall and assess‚Ä¶ the plot of the 2015 movie reboot, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World#Plot">Jurassic World</a></strong> üëç.</p>

<h3>Test results</h3>
<p>Here are the results of autosmry after applying it to the plot of Jurassic World:</p>

<p>That‚Äôs pretty cool! The Indominus Rex is indeed the main villain of the movie and is the cause of all the action to our protagonists!</p>

<div id="test-2-rainbow-six-novel" class="section level2">
<h2>Test 2: Rainbow Six Novel</h2>
<p>For the second test, I went with a longer piece of text, the plot summary to the novel <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Six_(novel)#Plot_summary">Rainbow Six</a></strong> by Tom Clancy.</p>
