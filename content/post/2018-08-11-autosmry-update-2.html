<div id="updates" class="section level2">
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p><strong>1. Dynamic number of sentences - autoSmry now attempts to find a more appropriate number of sentences for longer texts (previously defaulted to max of 5)</strong></p>
<p>This will hopefully work better for longer texts.</p>
<p><strong>2. I added additional support for other languages: Russian &amp; Chinese now added</strong></p>
</div>
