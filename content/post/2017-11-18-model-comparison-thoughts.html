<p>While developing my hybrid financial model, I quickly realized that I needed a quick visual method to compare my new model performance with the traditional manual model currently in use by BMO.</p>
<p>I decided to focus first and foremost on model prediction accuracy (partly because there really is no comparison on speed… the hybrid model is <strong>fast!</strong>). The most obvious measure here, and it was one that I ran with for a while, is the absolute percentage error between the model predictions and the actual value.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose the actual value is 100, and Model A predicted 102, while Model B predicted 105. The absolute percentage error (APE) will simply be the distance between the prediction and the actual value, as a percentage of the actual value (in this case 100), without regard to whether the prediction was over or under.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
# Generate results
results &lt;- data.frame(Actual = 100, Model.A = 102, Model.B = 105)

# Calculate APE
results$APE.A &lt;- with(results, (Model.A / Actual - 1) %&gt;% abs())
results$APE.B &lt;- with(results, (Model.B / Actual - 1) %&gt;% abs())

# Show results
knitr::kable(results)</code></pre>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">Actual</th>
<th align="right">Model.A</th>
<th align="right">Model.B</th>
<th align="right">APE.A</th>
<th align="right">APE.B</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">100</td>
<td align="right">102</td>
<td align="right">105</td>
<td align="right">0.02</td>
<td align="right">0.05</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As shown above, the further the prediction is from actual, the greater the APE value is. Now, instead of looking at two numbers, I made it so that I simply subtracted the two APE values, so that if the APE difference is negative then Model B is better, and conversely if the APE difference is positive then Model B is worse.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>results$APE.diff &lt;- with(results, APE.B - APE.A)

knitr::kable(results)</code></pre>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right">Actual</th>
<th align="right">Model.A</th>
<th align="right">Model.B</th>
<th align="right">APE.A</th>
<th align="right">APE.B</th>
<th align="right">APE.diff</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">100</td>
<td align="right">102</td>
<td align="right">105</td>
<td align="right">0.02</td>
<td align="right">0.05</td>
<td align="right">0.03</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can guess from this rather trivial example, Model B is worse since the APE difference is positive. In addition to seeing whether Model B is better or worse, we can also see how much better or how much worse Model B is by the magnitude of the APE difference.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this works with a variety of accuracies. First the data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Generate data
results &lt;- data.frame(Actual = rep(100, 20), 
                      Model.A = rep(105, 20), 
                      Model.B = c(seq(50, 150, length.out = 18), 100.001, 300),
                      Date = 2017: (2017+19))

# Calculate APE
results$APE.A &lt;- with(results, (Model.A / Actual - 1) %&gt;% abs())
results$APE.B &lt;- with(results, (Model.B / Actual - 1) %&gt;% abs())
results$APE.diff &lt;- with(results, APE.B - APE.A)

# Plot values
ggplot(results, aes(x = Date)) +
        geom_line(aes(y = Actual, linetype = &quot;Actual&quot;)) +
        geom_line(aes(y = Model.A, linetype = &quot;Model A&quot;)) +
        geom_line(aes(y = Model.B, linetype = &quot;Model B&quot;)) +
        ylab(&quot;Values&quot;) +
        theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-18-model-comparison-thoughts_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>To summarize, the Actual values are a constant 100, Model A has a constant prediction of 105, and Model B has an escalating prediction, starting at 50.</p>
<p>Looking at our sole measure of which model is better, APE difference, shows us this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(results, aes(x = Date, y = APE.diff)) +
        geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +
        ylab(&quot;APE difference (Model B - Model A)&quot;) +
        theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-18-model-comparison-thoughts_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The above graph shows the performance of Model B, compared with Model A at various predictions. The bigger the upward bar, the worse off Model B is, and the bigger the downward bar, the better off Model B is. Here is where I had my first conundrum… a very very good prediction (second last prediction, where Model B had almost perfect accuracy) was basically not visible at all, while a very very bad prediction (last prediction) is clearly taking up all of the visual space. This is because this APE difference system I devised is not symmetrical (it is bound between APE.A and <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>). What I need is a symmetrical system…</p>

<pre class="r"><code># Calculate log-diff
results$APE.log.diff &lt;- with(results, log(APE.B) - log(APE.A))

# Plot results
ggplot(results, aes(x = Date, y = APE.log.diff)) +
        geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +
        ylab(&quot;APE log. difference (Model B - Model A)&quot;) +

<p>By transforming the scores to the logarithmic scale, it is now symmetrical and bound between (<span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>). Thus, a very very bad prediction will not hog all of the visual space, while a very very good prediction will have a proportionate share of the visual space. (Or as xkcd would put it… I just took the easy way out… =D).</p>
