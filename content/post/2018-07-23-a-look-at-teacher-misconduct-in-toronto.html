<p>A couple of years back there was a news article written about someone that I went to high school with. We were in the same grade and we shared many classes together, including some extra-curricular classes like band class. We were never that close, and we never stayed in contact after high school, but nonetheless I recognized the name and picture when I saw it.</p>
<p>It turns out that he made the news because he was charged with “sexual exploitation” of a student of his while he was a teacher at a high school that was about 10 min away from where I now live. I recently just drove by that high school, and that prompted me to look into that case and whether he was found guilty or not (he was).</p>
<p>While exploring the internet for the results of his hearing, I found that the Toronto District School Board has a website that lists all offenses from presumably all teachers, going as far back as 2012 or so. It piqued my interest to explore this dataset a bit more fully than to simply look up a past classmate’s fate.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>I used a word embedding layer to reconstruct the linguistic context of the words. I then used relatively novel technique for dimensionality reduction called uniform manifold approximation to reduce the 300 dimensional word embedding layer to 2 dimensions for easy visualization.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First thing that jumped out at me was male teachers represent more than 2x the number of female teachers. I don’t have a gender split of the total number of teachers available, but going by my own anecdotal experience, female teachers likely outnumber male teachers. So the fact that male teachers dominate misconduct hearings is even more significant.</p></li>
<li><p>The word “consensual” only appears for female teachers.</p></li>
<li>I can see a few easy to interpret clusters of text from the hearings:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>sexual behaviour with students</li>
<li>borderline sexual behaviour, but not full on sex (i.e. flirty behaviour)</li>
<li>physical abuse</li>
<li>mental abuse</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Some odd clusters of text:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>hot/cold/wet conditions?</li>

 C. Robert Clements Registration No:  266425 Decision:  Revoked <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered the Registrar to revoke the certificate of C. Robert Clements for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old male. <br><br> Clements, who joined the teaching profession in June 1964, did not attend the August 25, 2011 hearing and was not represented. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, in January 2009, Clements invited the boy to his home where he fondled the boy. Subsequently, Clements was found guilty of sexual assault in criminal court and sentenced to 12 months probation. As well, he was ordered not to contact the boy or his family, not to be in the presence of anyone under 16 except with the child’s parent(s) present, not to possess any weapons for 10 years and to attend treatment and counselling. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member engaged in inappropriate and unprofessional conduct with the student while that student was under his care and supervision,” the panel said. “The member’s conduct is disgraceful and unbecoming a member of the profession. Revocation is the appropriate penalty for misconduct of this severity and protects the public interest.” <br><br> ","Member:  Johannes Albert Heller Registration No:  275452 Decision:  Revoked <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered the Registrar to revoke the certificate of Thames Valley DSB secondary school teacher Johannes Albert Heller for sexually assaulting young males and making and accessing child pornography. <br><br> Heller joined the teaching profession in June 1996. He did not attend the August 25, 2011 hearing and was not represented. <br><br> In December 2010, Heller pleaded guilty in criminal court to sexually touching a person under the age of 16, making child pornography, inviting a young person to touch his body for a sexual purpose and committing sexual assault. He was sentenced to six years in jail, and other conditions were imposed, including an order prohibiting him from possessing firearms for 10 years. <br><br> The school board fired Heller in January 2011. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and the submission of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Heller guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “Although the young male was not a student of the member, the committee affirms that the pattern of grooming behaviour evident through the use of drugs, alcohol and pornography represents a threat to students who may be in the member’s care,” the panel said. <br><br> “The committee finds that that member who is convicted of sexual assault and accessing and making child pornography is not suitable to be in a position of trust and authority over children. He has entirely failed in that trust and is considered by the courts of Ontario to have broken laws that protect the young and is incarcerated as a result of these convictions. This member should not be permitted to teach in Ontario.” <br><br> ","Member:  Joanne Marie Sylvie Léger-Legault Registration No:  185327 Decision:  Revoked <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered the Registrar to revoke the certificate of Ottawa-Carleton DSB secondary school teacher Joanne Marie Sylvie Léger-Legault for her inappropriate relations with four male students, including intimate sexual relationships with two. <br><br> Léger-Legault, who joined the teaching profession in June 1992, had legal counsel attend the hearing, which was conducted on May 25 and September 27, 2011, on her behalf. <br><br> Between 2001 and 2005, Léger-Legault transported students in her car, met with them outside school, discussed personal issues, exchanged text messages and emails of an inappropriate personal nature, kissed one student on the lips and had intimate sexual relationships with two students. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and legal submissions, the Discipline Committee panel found Léger-Legault guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke her Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The committee finds that, over a period of four years, the member engaged in inappropriate behaviour involving four students, including sexual abuse of three of those students,” the panel said. “The conduct of the member was unacceptable, in conflict with the duty of a teacher and a breach of the public trust. The member has forfeited the privilege of holding a teaching certificate and membership in the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded a Toronto DSB teacher for using inappropriate language and physical discipline with students. <br><br> The member, who joined the teaching profession in August 1998, attended the November 8, 2011 public hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> Between 2002 and 2006, the member made inappropriate comments and used physical discipline on a number of occasions, resulting in two letters of discipline from his principal. Then, in another instance, the member picked up a student under the arm, which, when the student resisted, resulted in the student falling and hitting his head. Consequently, the member received another letter of discipline. The board fired the member in February 2007 but reinstated him in June 2008. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, a plea of no contest, a statement of uncontested facts, and a joint submission on penalty, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The member was ordered to face the panel to receive a reprimand and to complete a course in classroom management at his own expense. <br><br> Among its comments, the panel said, “The member exercised unreasonable approaches to disciplining students in his care. (He) jokingly told a student, ‘Why don’t you just run away?’ which was an inappropriate comment to make to a young and impressionable student.” <br><br> ","Member:  Mark Christopher Baggio Registration No:  421255 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Windsor-Essex Catholic DSB teacher Mark Christopher Baggio for criminal convictions involving sexual assault, sexual exploitation and communicating with a person under 18 for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence, affecting two female students. <br><br> Baggio was certified to teach in August 1998. He was not present at the October 18, 2011 hearing, nor was he represented. <br><br> Between January 2000 and January 2004, Baggio groomed and engaged in a sexual relationship with one student. In an overlapping period between September 2002 and May 2005, he systematically groomed and engaged in a sexual relationship with another female student at the school. According to the evidence, he befriended the students and participated in inappropriate communications with them, including thousands of telephone calls and almost 100 retrieved e-mails. Many of the phone calls were made between 9 PM and 6 AM. The communications became increasingly sexual in nature and led to kissing, fondling, oral sex and sexual intercourse, often occurring several times a week and in various locations, including at the school, in Baggio’s car and at his home. The board fired him in February 2006. <br><br> On January 8, 2009, Baggio was sentenced to four years in jail. His appeal of the sentence was dismissed on January 25, 2011. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Baggio guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certifi cate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “[Baggio’s] abuse of these two students, who were both under the age of 18 years, was solely for his personal sexual gratifi cation,” the Discipline Committee panel said. “He breached his position of trust as a teacher and a coach. The abuse perpetrated by the member was not a single random act, but rather was a premeditated frequent pattern of abuse extending over a period of three or four years. The lack of any evidence of remorse demonstrates his disregard for the harm that his crimes have caused the two students and their families. <br><br> “Revocation serves the purposes of denouncing unprofessional conduct, deterring members of the profession from engaging in similar misconduct, and protecting students in the future.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Counselled <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel found a Simcoe County DSB elementary teacher guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to appear before the panel to be counselled for a kicking incident. <br><br> The member, who joined the teaching profession in June 1992, attended the November 1, 2011 public hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> While on supervisory lunch duty in May 2009, the member entered a portable classroom and saw that students’ shoes had not been placed against the wall as he had previously instructed. The member kicked the shoes, some of which landed outside the classroom. In so doing, the member’s foot connected with a male Grade 4 student. The student said he fell and suffered minor scraping to his midto-lower back as a result. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, a plea of no contest, a statement of uncontested facts and a joint submission on penalty, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct. The member was ordered to face the panel to be counselled. <br><br> Explaining its decision, the panel said the 19-year veteran teacher had not appeared before the committee previously and had completed a course in behaviour management, and that the incident was of a “minor nature.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Counselled, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel found a Toronto DSB intermediate level teacher guilty of professional misconduct for unprofessional behaviour in the school office in front of students and staff. <br><br> The member, who joined the teaching profession in June 1991, attended the October 31, 2011 public hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> In October 2007, the member asked a female student to deliver a male student’s belongings to him after he had been transferred to another homeroom. The male student became angry when he discovered that one of the items was soiled and tried twice to visit the member’s classroom to find out how it had happened. During one of the visits, the student, in a display of anger, spilled the contents of a garbage can on the classroom floor. <br><br> On returning to the classroom and finding the spill, the member commented about the male student’s conduct to another teacher who was present in the classroom. One or more students who were also present may have overheard the comment. <br><br> Later, the boy confronted the member in the hallway and accused him, in the presence of a female student, of referring to him as a “nigger.” The member denied it and sought immediate help from the office. The member told the girl to come with him to the office. The male student followed. <br><br> At the office, the member demanded in a loud voice that the vice-principal tell him what the administration would do to address the boy’s continued behaviour. The member also demanded in a loud voice that the girl confirm what the boy had said to him in the hallway. During the exchange, the member became upset and repeated the boy’s comment to the vice-principal in front of the girl, the boy and staff in the office. <br><br> The Toronto Police and the Children’s Aid Society investigated and determined that no further action was necessary because the member’s behaviour was not criminal in nature and there had been no physical assault. <br><br> The board suspended the member for five days without pay, discontinued his teacher-mentor coach position in the family of schools and directed him to attend anger management and equity training. <br><br> The member grieved the board’s disciplinary actions, and the suspension was reduced to one day. The member continued to teach at the school until June 2011. In September, he began teaching at another elementary school in the board. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, a plea of no contest, a statement of uncontested facts, a joint submission on penalty and the submission of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct. The member was ordered to face the panel to be counselled. He was also directed to complete, at his own expense, a course in anger management with a particular emphasis on positive discipline strategies and the defusing of aggressive and negative student behaviours and attitudes. <br><br> “Publication, without the name of the member, will provide general deterrence in that members of the profession will be made aware of how an isolated event can affect a longstanding career,” the panel said in its decision. <br><br> “The committee accepted that publication with name would unduly punish the member. The member has had a long successful career and this incident was an isolated event. The behaviour was on the low end of the scale.” <br><br> ","Member:  Michael Wayne Plews Registration No:  253860 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Peel DSB elementary teacher Michael Wayne Plews in connection with a criminal conviction for common assault against three female students. <br><br> Plews was first certified to teach in June 1983. He did not attend the November 1, 2011 hearing but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In April 2007, Plews was charged with three counts of common assault against three students and was found guilty in January 2011. He was sentenced to 10 months in jail to be served on a conditional basis. In April 2011, he resigned from the board. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the Discipline Committee panel found Plews guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “[Plews] engaged in inappropriate physical contact with three female students, which resulted in subsisting physical injuries and long term emotional harm as evidenced by the victim impact statements,” the panel said. “The conduct included tickling, wrestling, inappropriate touching without consent, rough housing, ‘manhandling’ and shoving these students. <br><br> “In his reasons for judgment, Mr. Justice Hill, in referring to the victim impact statements, noted that the students spoke collectively of ‘broken trust, anger, humiliation, selfblame and manipulation.’ ” ","Member:  Antonio Raco Registration No:  169219 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Windsor-Essex Catholic DSB teacher Antonio Raco for conduct leading to a criminal conviction for sexual assault involving minor students. <br><br> Raco was certified to teach in June 1979. Neither he nor representative legal counsel attended the hearing on September 15 and November 17, 2011. <br><br> Working at several schools in the district over 14 years, Raco “fostered a flirtatious and sexual atmosphere in his classroom.” <br><br> In October 2009, the Ontario Superior Court convicted Raco of sexual assault, for which he was sentenced to six months in jail followed by three years probation. The conditions of probation held that Raco take rehabilitative programs for sexual offending, that he not associate with two students, their families or any former students who were witnesses at the trial, that he not be in the presence of anyone under 16 without adult supervision and that he not assume a teaching role with anyone under 16. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Raco guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member created a group of females who were his favourites,” the Discipline Committee panel said in its decision. “He controlled this group by including them when they pleased him or ostracizing them or causing them to be ostracized by the others when they displeased him. He often played the ‘red light, green light’ game with them. In this game he would place his hand on their leg, approximately at the knee, and start to move it upwards. At some point the student would say ‘red light’ at which time he would stop immediately. Evidence further indicates that the member engaged in sexual assault and touching students for sexual purposes that included touching a student’s breast over her bathing suit, unbuttoning the top button of a student’s blouse and kissing a student. <br><br> “These were unwanted touchings of vulnerable children to which they, by virtue of their age, were unable to legally consent. Even if they were legally able to consent, that consent would have been vitiated by the member’s position of trust as their teacher. <br><br> “The member, having been convicted of two counts of sexual assault and one count of touching students for a sexual purpose, demonstrates that he should not be a teacher in a position of trust and authority,” the panel said. “The committee finds the member’s conduct is disgraceful and unbecoming a member of the profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of a Durham DSB teacher for sexually abusing a student. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 2001, represented herself at the November 24, 2011 public hearing. <br><br> Between December 2008 and February 2009, the member developed a personal and sexual relationship with the student that involved her kissing the student, performing fellatio, allowing him to touch her breasts and undressing in front of him after they had finished running and training together. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that the member was found guilty in criminal court in July 2009 for assault on the student. She was sentenced to 45 days in jail and a 12-month conditional sentence, during which she was to be confined to her home. As well, she was prohibited from seeking, obtaining or continuing employment and for 10 years volunteering in a capacity that involved being in a position of trust or authority toward anyone under 16. <br><br> She resigned from the board in August 2009. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke her Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> The panel decided to withhold the member’s name from publication in Professionally Speaking on the grounds that publication of her name might identify the victim. <br><br> ","Member:  Gavin John Bradford Registration No:  472405 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Gavin John Bradford for inappropriate, sexually laced electronic communication with female students. <br><br> Bradford was certified to teach in August 2004. He did not attend the November 24, 2011 hearing, nor was he represented. <br><br> The former Halton DSB intermediate-level teacher used MSN Messenger or webcam to communicate on several occasions with at least 21 female students during the 2006– 07 school year, in several cases late at night. He also spoke inappropriately with students at school. <br><br> For example, Bradford repeatedly asked a student to wear a white shirt and pour or spill water on herself, at least once asking that she do it in front of the webcam while he watched. He asked several girls if they would let him put a pie down their pants and reciprocate by doing the same to him. He told another student he would let her put mud down his pants and asked two others to make a video “peeing” their pants while they were on webcam. Further, he told students his favourite swear words and demonstrated using them in a sentence. <br><br> “The behaviour may have started out innocently but escalated to the point of using vulgar language and making improper suggestions of an explicit sexual nature,” the Discipline Committee panel said. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Bradford guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded a Durham Catholic DSB music teacher for using the confiscated cell phone of a male student to send text messages to a female student. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in December 2005, attended the February 2, 2012 hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that the member used the male student’s phone to tell the female student, “I think you are cute” and to ask, “What are you doing this weekend?” The member also told the female student, “I like your pyjamas” while she was standing next to a vending machine during a school pyjama day. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The member was ordered to face the panel following the hearing for a reprimand and was directed to complete a course in appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues at his own expense. ","Member:  Wayne Clark Thompson Registration No:  317597 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of DSB of Niagara (formerly the Lincoln County Board of Education) teacher Wayne Clark Thompson for sexually abusing students. <br><br> Thompson was certified to teach in June 1961. He did not attend the April 30, 2012, hearing and was not represented by legal counsel. Between 1973 and 1976, Thompson engaged in sexual conversations and oral sex with two male students aged 12 and 13. He also encouraged sexual contact between the boys. <br><br> Thompson retired in 1994 and was charged with four counts of indecent assault by Niagara Regional Police in May 2009. He was found guilty and sentenced to two years in jail followed by three years’ probation, including conditions that prohibited him from attending public parks, swimming areas, daycare centres, school grounds, playgrounds or community centres where children under 16 were present. <br><br> As well, he was prohibited from seeking, obtaining or continuing in any job for pay or as a volunteer that involved being in a position of authority toward anyone under 16. Further, Thompson was directed not to contact, communicate or be alone with young people unless in the company of their parents or guardian, and that he not use computers to communicate with anyone under 16. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Thompson guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel said that Thompson forfeited the privilege of being in the teaching profession. <br><br> “The (panel) considered the power imbalance that exists in favour of the teacher, the vulnerability of students and the privileged position of teachers in society. The victim impact statements of Student 1 and Student 2 indicated the long term, harmful and life-altering consequences the member’s action had on their lives. Sexual abuse by a teacher brings the profession into disrepute and tarnishes public trust in the profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of a York Region DSB teacher for sexually abusing a student. <br><br> The member, certified to teach in July 1998, and his legal counsel attended the hearing held on October 11, 2011, December 19 and 22, 2011, and February 16 and 17, 2012. <br><br> Between May 2004 and 2005, the member met the student at least four times and communicated with her electronically. They met for pizza, he told her he loved her and wanted to be in bed with her; he hugged, kissed and rubbed his body against hers; and he touched or attempted to touch her breast. <br><br> In a February 2004 email exchange, the member referenced a sexual act that, when reported by the student, led to a board investigation and written reprimand, and sensitivity training arranged by his federation. Despite warnings, his email correspondence continued, as did the meetings with the student. <br><br> The student complained to another teacher, who told the girl’s mother. A Children’s Aid Society investigation and police charges resulted. A criminal trial was conducted in July 2008 and the teacher was acquitted in 2009. <br><br> During testimony, the student acknowledged that she actively pursued a relationship with the member. “I was 15 years old and blinded by my own romantic notions,” she said. She also said the member said that he couldn’t continue the relationship because he would go to jail or lose his job, but that he sent mixed messages and was always prepared to meet with her. The member admitted “errors in judgment” and that he used inappropriate language, but he denied any sexual intent in his contact. He said the kiss was not romantic and was unintended. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the Discipline Committee panel said, “The member was fully aware of the Professional Advisory of the Ontario College of Teachers but, in spite of this, like a moth attracted to a flame, he persisted in actions that he knew were just plain wrong. No amount of selfserving explanation can justify his behaviour or make it appear to be right. <br><br> “The committee strongly believes that the member, when given such a clear message through a formal reprimand from his employer, should have ended all communication with (the student). When she attempted to renew communication with the member, he responded affirmatively, when he knew that he should not, and knew that it was unprofessional to do so. <br><br> “In the view of the committee, the member disregarded very specific rules and some very good advice. He willfully chose to continue this inappropriate relationship. Not to revoke would deny the true nature of this matter. This is, after all, a case of sexual misconduct.” <br><br> The panel members wrote in their decision that they would have ordered the member’s name published in this summary, but could not due to a publication ban ordered by the Ontario Court of Justice.","Member:  Natalie Marie Denise Champagne Registration No:  495849 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A panel of the Discipline Committee has directed the Registrar to revoke the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Nathalie Marie Denise Champagne, a secondary-school teacher with the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud, for having had sexual relations with a 16-year-old student. <br><br> Champagne became a member of the College in June 2005. She did not attend the hearing on June 20, 2012, nor was she represented by a lawyer. <br><br> Between 2007 and 2009, she engaged in telephone conversations and emails of an intimate and inappropriate nature with several students, and committed sexual acts with one of them by video conference, which was viewed by students of the school. <br><br> Having reviewed the evidence — and considering the plea of no contest — the agreement on the undisputed facts, the joint recommendation on the penalty and the representations by counsel, the panel agreed that Champagne is guilty of professional misconduct and has directed the Registrar to revoke the Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “Ms. Champagne demonstrated conduct that is reprehensible and unbecoming of a member of the profession. She abused the authority and trust associated with her role as a teacher for purposes of her own sexual indulgence, without regard for the student’s well-being,” concluded the committee in its decision. <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded a Toronto DSB high school teacher for breaching appropriate teacher-student boundaries. <br><br> Certified to teach in July 2001, the member attended the August 8, 2012, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> In 2010, the member grabbed a student’s hooded sweatshirt when he refused to properly dispose of a can in a recycling container. She then attempted to grab the cellphone of another student who threatened to film the incident. The teacher put her hand on the shoulder of the second student, who lost his balance and fell, and then closed and locked her classroom door to prevent students entering. When the first student tried to enter, she pushed him and swore at him to leave. <br><br> Subsequently, the school board suspended the teacher for 15 days. Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The member was ordered to face the panel after the hearing to receive a reprimand. As well, she was ordered to complete a course at her own expense regarding appropriate boundaries, boundary violation issues and anger management. <br><br> ","Member:  Thomas Paul Karrow, OCT Registration No:  452996 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded former Bluewater DSB principal Thomas Paul Karrow for engaging in an inappropriate relationship with an 11-year-old student. <br><br> Karrow, who was certified in August 2002, attended the May 23, 2012, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that between November 2009 and January 2010 Karrow loaned a school board computer to the student, engaged in ongoing electronic communication of a personal nature with her, invited the girl and her mother to stay overnight at his home, exchanged gifts and accepted money from the girl. Several times, he was alone in his office with the student for extended periods, took her to dinner alone to a restaurant with her mother’s permission, and sat alone with her in his car. <br><br> Karrow said that he was assisting the student related to bullying that she was experiencing, but acknowledged that his conduct violated professional boundaries. He resigned from the board in February 2010 and has not taught students or supervised teachers since. After resigning, he underwent counselling and completed a course in ethical practices and boundaries. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Karrow guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> He was ordered to face the panel to receive a reprimand. Prior to returning to work, he must provide the Registrar with a written certificate from a certified psychologist or psychiatrist stating that he is able to return to full-time classroom duty or professional duties as teacher or administrator without any undue risk of harm or injury to students. <br><br> ","Member:  Deoraj Narine Registration No:  215785 Decision:  Suspension, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of Toronto DSB high school science teacher Deoraj Narine for three months for making inappropriate comments to an 18-yearold pregnant student, for treating students disrespectfully and using classroom management strategies that raised safety concerns. <br><br> Narine, who was certified in June 1992, represented himself at the June 13 and 14, 2012, hearing. <br><br> The panel heard evidence of events at two separate schools involving Narine. In the first, an 18-year-old pregnant student reported to school administrators and police that in April 2008 Narine called her a “shithead,” complained that her baby would cost him money as a taxpayer and had she listened to him “would have had it taken out.” She also said he said, “I feel sorry for you anyways because it’s [the baby] going to grow up in a world of violence and shit.” <br><br> After being moved to another school, Narine had treated students disrespectfully, yelled and swore at them, told them to “shut up” and used ineffective classroom management strategies. Witnesses said that Narine did not apply appropriate protocols, engaged in verbal exchanges with students regularly, and that his classroom was “chaotic.” After an investigation, the school board formally reprimanded the teacher, suspended him for 10 days and informed the College. Narine denied all the allegations. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel and the member, the Discipline Committee panel found Narine guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The panel ordered the Registrar to suspend Narine’s certificate for three months and directed him to complete courses on classroom management and sensitivity training at his own expense within a year. <br><br> ","Member:  Anthony John Park Registration No:  265965 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Durham Catholic DSB teacher Anthony John Park and ordered that his certificate be suspended for three months for using sexualized language with his class and certain students. <br><br> Park, certified to teach in December 1995, attended the February 2, 2012, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> In 2004, the school board disciplined Park for inappropriate interactions with two female students on a field trip. He received a disciplinary transfer to another school, underwent a psychiatric assessment and took a boundaries course. <br><br> Then in 2007–08, Park told a student, who was cold and asked to get a sweater, to “come over, I’ll warm you up.” He told a student he wished she were his daughter and that she could go home with him. He confiscated a Cosmopolitan magazine from another girl and, flipping though the pages, said to the class, “You could learn some things from the articles” and then read aloud a headline that said “Why do women want to have sex all the time?” <br><br> While writing on a blackboard, Park looked back to the class and said “Girls, stop looking at my butt.” And while describing organisms, cells, trees and plants during a lesson, Park said “A stem is long, sometimes it goes hard, sometimes it’s soft.” <br><br> In November 2008, the Durham Catholic board fired him. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Park guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The panel ordered the Registrar to suspend Park’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration for three months. It ordered him to face the panel to be reprimanded and further ordered him to complete a course on boundaries and boundary violation issues at his own expense. <br><br> “The member has demonstrated a low level of awareness of boundaries and appropriate forms of address and communication with his students,” the panel said in its written decision. “He has done so repeatedly and over a number of years. <br><br> “The reprimand allows the profession to communicate with the member about his behaviour and transgressions and therefore serves a specific deterrent. The three-month suspension sends a very clear message to the member and the profession that this type of behaviour is viewed very seriously. A specific deterrent is also put into effect by the boundaries course and the three-month suspension. Publication with name makes it clear to the member that he failed in acting as a member of the profession and needs to reflect on his failure.” <br><br> The panel expressed concern that the member was a recidivist and that the proposed penalty might be ineffective. The proposed penalty mirrored the penalty the school board imposed on an earlier occasion for behaviour of the same type that had been demonstrated by the member. The panel said it hoped joint submissions on penalty might be more sensitive to current expectations and, in cases such as this, most particularly about the issue of recidivism. However, the penalty was not a marked departure from the joint submission on penalty and, by accepting it, the discipline process was not compromised. <br><br> ","Member:  Peter Gordon Lewer, OCT Registration No:  403576 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Hamilton-Wentworth DSB high school science teacher Peter Gordon Lewer for physically assaulting a student and for harassing and physically assaulting another teacher when their relationship ended. <br><br> Lewer was certified in June 1993. He represented himself at the September 25, 2012, hearing. <br><br> The panel considered evidence from two separate incidents. In October 2004, Lewer grabbed a 15-year-old male student by the shirt, pushed him into a gym wall, and applied force causing the boy to fall. And, subsequent to a relationship with an elementary school teacher during the 2005–06 school year, Lewer visited her home unannounced, refused to leave when asked, caused her to believe he was stalking her and to fear for her safety, and removed and replaced mail from her residential mailbox. Between September and October 2006, he became physical with the woman, causing her pain and facial bruising, which resulted in a criminal charge of harassment and his agreeing to enter into a peace bond with respect to the charge. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel and the member, the Discipline Committee panel found Lewer guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to face the panel for a reprimand. <br><br> The panel also ordered Lewer to complete rehabilitative courses at his own expense on anger management and appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues.","Member:  Albert Wierenga Registration No:  148259 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of Albert Wierenga, a teacher at a private school in Newmarket, for inappropriate physical interactions with students and for making comments with sexual overtones about former students on Facebook. <br><br> Wierenga, who was certified to teach in June 1979, did not attend the October 11, 2012, hearing, nor was he represented by a lawyer. <br><br> In the fall of 2008, Wierenga knelt in front of a student and made a slashing motion across the front of her knees to indicate where her skirt length should have been. In doing so, he may have touched her knee. <br><br> In February 2009, while performing uniform checks, Wierenga touched the jaw of a student, asking if she had gum in her mouth. A school administrator verbally cautioned him as a result. <br><br> Wierenga was also found to have put his hands on the hips of a student attempting a 12-foot horizontal climb so she could successfully finish, and put another student across his knee as if to spank her after she swept dirt in his path while voluntarily cleaning nearby sheep farms. <br><br> Between November 2009 and September 2010, Wierenga posted comments to Facebook about former students who had gone on to university. For example, he referred to a former female student as “babe,” used the term “going commando” and referred to a picture of a former student and her boyfriend kissing as “an anaconda and crocodile struggling to swallow each other.” <br><br> The member retired from the school in October 2010. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Wierenga guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The panel ordered Wierenga’s certificate suspended for a month, directed him to face the panel for a reprimand and ordered him to complete a course on professional boundaries at his own expense. <br><br> ","Member:  Robert Louis Pickering Registration No:  388472 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Robert Louis Pickering, a private school teacher in Thornhill, in connection with a criminal conviction for sexual assault against two female students. <br><br> Certified in June 1982, Pickering did not attend the October 16, 2012, hearing, nor was he represented by a lawyer. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that the member befriended an exchange student, who saw him as a father and/or brother-like figure and a source of comfort. They both enjoyed music and built guitars together. As time passed and when no one was around, Pickering gave her little nudges, which progressed to hugs and then kisses, first on the cheek and then the lips. The student recalled a couple of occasions in 1985 where he fondled her breasts and asked her on prom night to have sexual intercourse. She declined. <br><br> Pickering was a staff adviser to the second student during her high school years. One night during a camping trip, he massaged the girl’s back and, as others left, kissed her and invited her back to his tent where they engaged in groping and sexual touching. The relationship continued in 1992 during the student’s Grade 12 year, mostly at school in science labs and in the guidance office. Pickering also had sexual intercourse with the girl after the prom and once on a playing field. <br><br> In 2010, York Regional Police charged Pickering with sexual assault against the first student and sexual assault and touching a young person for a sexual purpose regarding the 1992 incidents. Pickering pleaded guilty and was found guilty on two counts of sexual assault in 2011. In May that year, he was given a two-year conditional sentence, including one year of house arrest followed by three years of probation. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Pickering guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> “A member who has been convicted of sexual assault against his students is not suitable to be in a position of trust and authority over children and, therefore, his Certificate of Qualification and Registration must be revoked,” the Discipline Committee panel said. <br><br> ","Member:  Larry J. Greenspan Registration No:  246914 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded former Toronto DSB high school teacher Larry J. Greenspan for inappropriate comments and unprofessional behaviour with two female students. <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1981, Greenspan did not attend the November 7, 2012, hearing, but he was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In the 2004–05 and 2005–06 school years, Greenspan taught Special Education and supervised/coached girls’ basketball teams at a Toronto DSB high school. He made a number of inappropriate comments to one student that could be interpreted as sexual innuendo. He also touched the student, and a second student, in a manner the committee found unprofessional. <br><br> Greenspan said he would often pat the shoulders or backs of players he was coaching to congratulate, encourage or console them. Regarding the comments, he said they were intended to be humorous. <br><br> Greenspan retired from the Toronto DSB in 2010. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, the statement of uncontested facts, the plea of no contest, and the representations by counsel, the panel found Greenspan guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to face the panel after the hearing to receive a reprimand and appeared for that purpose in January 2013. He was also ordered to complete two courses at his own expense regarding appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues, and classroom management with particular emphasis on positive discipline strategies within three months of the date of the order. <br><br> “Members of the profession must be aware of expectations regarding professional behaviour and recognize the significance and serious implications of engaging in unprofessional conduct,” the panel wrote in its decision. “The reprimand of the member in respect of his inappropriate communication and behaviour with students serves as a specific deterrent to such conduct. The fact that the reprimand will be recorded on the register further serves as a specific deterrent to the member and a general deterrent to the profession regarding unprofessional conduct.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded a Toronto DSB elementary teacher for inappropriately touching two special needs students. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 1981, attended the October 15, 2012, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, on separate occasions in May 2008, the member grabbed the arms of students with autism who were having difficulty focusing and finishing their work to redirect them to their seats. In a separate incident, she asked one of the same students, who was disturbing the class by making funny faces and noises, to “be quiet” and then used two fingers to pull the student’s lips down into a frown and told him to stop laughing. On both occasions, the member intervened when the educational assistant was unable to manage the student. <br><br> The member argued that she had been taught that students with autism often respond better to physical rather than verbal cues and that her touching of the students resulted from the teaching strategy. <br><br> In March 2009, the board suspended the teacher for four days without pay for the events in May 2008. She has been teaching at another school since without incident. Prior to the hearing, the member completed a course in classroom management and received counselling in anger management. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered her to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> “The member has acknowledged that the behaviour was inappropriate and has taken steps of her own accord to remediate,” the panel said in its written decision. <br><br> ","Member:  Stephen Michael Lane Registration No:  313409 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Stephen Michael Lane for possessing child pornography.

He pleaded guilty to the charge in August 2011, and in November 2011 was sentenced to nine months in jail followed by two years probation. Further, he was prohibited from coming into contact with anyone under 16 in a work or volunteer situation, via computer or in community settings such as parks, school grounds, swimming areas or community centres for 10 years. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Maycock guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> ","Member:  Eric Gerard Brouillard Registration No:  456554 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Eric Gerard Brouillard in connection with a criminal conviction for sexual assault involving a Grade 8 girl. <br><br> Brouillard, who was certified to teach in 2002 and was working as an elementary teacher for the Conseil scolaire catholique du Nouvel-Ontario at the time of the incident, did not attend the November 28, 2011, hearing, nor was he represented by a lawyer. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel heard evidence that Brouillard pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual assault in November 2009 after the mother of a female student he was teaching discovered the teacher and her daughter kissing in the back seat of his truck in a local park. <br><br> Brouillard received a suspended sentence with 24-months probation, was directed to seek rehabilitative assessment and counselling, and was ordered not to come within 100 metres of the student’s residence, school or place of employment. That same month, he resigned from the board. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Brouillard guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member abused the authority and trust vested in him in his role as a teacher, without regard for the well-being of the student,” the Discipline Committee panel said. “The conduct of the member was unacceptable and in conflict with the duty of a teacher to protect students. The member, as a result of his conduct, has forfeited the privilege of holding a teaching certificate and being a member of the teaching profession.

Later, the sleeping woman was awakened by a rocking motion and discovered a man having intercourse with her without her consent. <br><br> On the basis of DNA testing, Wood was arrested, charged and convicted of the assault. He did not appeal the conviction or the sentence. <br><br> The panel agreed with Justice B.G. Mac Dougall who said that Wood “took advantage of a very vulnerable victim” and “engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse with all of its inherent risks to the victim.” <br><br> “As a result of his shameful conduct, the member has forfeited the privilege of holding a teaching certificate and being a member of the teaching profession,” the panel said. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel and the member, the Discipline Committee panel found Wood guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> ","Member:  John Ondricko, OCT Registration No:  393128 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Greater Essex County DSB elementary school teacher John Ondricko for using slang terminology and making inappropriate comments in his health class, and for references about the school custodian and black people. <br><br> Ondricko, who was certified in June 1993, did not attend the November 30, 2012, hearing, nor was his lawyer present. <br><br> In the 2010–11 school year, Ondricko’s teaching methods and the content of his Grade 7 health class went beyond the curriculum, and he was restricted from teaching health until June 2012. Ondricko also referred to the school custodian as the “Afro-American janitor” and referred to black people as “coloured people” in a history lesson. <br><br> In an agreed statement of facts, Ondricko said he used slang terminology in very limited circumstances in health class, solely for explaining the correct terminology to students. He also responded to various questions from students on sex education topics. He acknowledged that at times this went outside the health curriculum, however, his intention at all times was to attempt to demystify sexual education for the students and to resolve students’ misperceptions and inaccuracies. <br><br> Having examined the evidence, the agreement on the facts, the joint recommendation for resolution, the guilty plea and the submissions by College counsel, the panel agreed that Ondricko was guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to face the panel after the hearing to receive a reprimand. He was also ordered to complete a course regarding appropriate teacher-student boundaries. <br><br> ","Member:  Jan Francis Matejovic Registration No:  469523 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A panel of the Discipline Committee has directed the Registrar to revoke the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Jan Francis Matejovic, a science teacher at an independent school in Toronto, for sexually abusing a student. <br><br> Certified to teach in 2003, Matejovic attended the December 13, 2012, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> Between March and around September 2010, he engaged in emails of a sexual nature with a female student of the school who had been his student the year before. Following the student’s graduation, he engaged in a sexual relationship with her in early August 2010 that ended about one month later. <br><br> Having reviewed the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel — and considering the plea of no contest, the statement of uncontested facts and joint submission on penalty — the panel agreed that Matejovic is guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member engaged in reprehensible conduct unbecoming a member of the teaching profession. It made no difference that the student had graduated, was an adult or that she may have initiated the relationship. He abused the authority and trust associated with his role as a teacher,” concluded the committee in its decision. <br><br> Given that the member’s conduct was a very serious abuse of trust, the publication of his name is warranted and appropriate in the circumstances. Publication with the member’s name reiterates the message to the profession and to the public that behaviour of this nature will not be tolerated. <br><br> ","Member:  Marc Paul J. Bourgon Registration No:  161609 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A panel of the Discipline Committee has directed the Registrar to revoke the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Marc Paul J. Bourgon, an English and geography high school teacher with the Ottawa-Carleton DSB. <br><br> Certified to teach in 1978, Bourgon did not attend the hearing and was not represented by legal counsel. The hearing was initially set for February 2010 but occurred in November 2012 after the member requested numerous postponements. <br><br> Between 2004 and 2007, Bourgon:  <br><br> Bourgon misled the community to believe that the school board had endorsed the ETA programs. He ignored warnings from administration not to conduct ETA business through the school and that this was a conflict of interest. <br><br> He promised students that they could earn credits for their participation in the trips organized by his company but failed to make arrangements to allow them to do so. As a result, at least two students relied on these credits to graduate but were unable to do so. <br><br> Having reviewed the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions made by College counsel and information received on behalf of the member, the panel agreed that Bourgon is guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member put his own interests above those of his students by taking their money, their hopes and their dreams. The memories the students have are not the ones they signed up for. He brought the profession into disrepute through his actions. He used his position as a teacher to exploit students and their families for his own financial gain and compromised public confidence in the public education system,” concluded the panel in its decision. <br><br> ","Member:  Geoffrey Richard Ludkin Registration No:  536455 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Geoffrey Richard Ludkin, an occasional teacher for the Northeastern Catholic DSB and the DSB Ontario North East, for using a computer to lure a child for sexual purposes. <br><br> Ludkin, who was certified to teach in August 2008, did not attend the November 7, 2012, hearing, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In September 2011, Ludkin pleaded guilty to police charges of luring a child by way of computer for the purpose of sexual assault and luring for the purposes of procuring, and was sentenced to a year’s conditional sentence followed by two years of probation. Further, he was prohibited for five years from attending public parks, swimming areas, daycare centres, school grounds, playgrounds or community centres where anyone under 16 is or might be present. He was also prohibited from seeking, obtaining or continuing any job or volunteer position in which he might be in a position of trust toward anyone under 16, and from using a computer system to communicate with anyone under 16. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Ludkin guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> The committee panel found Ludkin’s offences to be “very disturbing.” <br><br> “Children are vulnerable members of society and must be safeguarded against predators who use the internet to lure them into a situation where they can be sexually exploited and abused,” the panel decision says. “The member’s actions were criminal and warrant revocation.” ","Member:  Jason James Ferris Registration No:  436464 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the teaching certificate of Trillium Lakelands DSB teacher Jason James Ferris, and reprimanded him for inappropriate social media communication and contact with students. <br><br> Ferris, who was certified to teach in June 2000, attended the January 28, 2013, hearing with his lawyer. <br><br> In February 2009, Ferris engaged in a Facebook conversation with a 14-year-old, Grade 8 girl in which he used the word “Fobi” meaning “f--- off bitch.” Ferris also took the student for lunch in his car without seeking permission or having her properly sign out with the school’s office. <br><br> During the 2008–09 school year, Ferris used inappropriate dialogue with current and/or former students on Facebook, including:  “don’t try to F with my knowledge grasshopper” and “whatever loser.” <br><br> The school board reported Ferris to the Family, Youth and Child Services of Muskoka, which said he had exploited his position of trust as a teacher by engaging students socially on Facebook. <br><br> Ferris misled school board officials by telling them he had removed all students from his Facebook friends list. He also lied about cellphone conversations he had with students that he said were strictly related to school, but which the board learned were social in nature. <br><br> In September 2010, Ferris resigned from the board. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Ferris guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, onus and standard of proof, and legal submissions. <br><br> He was ordered to face the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand. The Discipline Committee panel ordered the Registrar to suspend Ferris’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration for two months beginning on January 28, 2013. As well, Ferris was ordered to complete a pre-approved course at his own expense regarding boundaries and boundary violation issues and report to the Registrar on its successful completion within 30 days of finishing. <br><br> ","Member:  Dustin Phillip Rouse Registration No:  504142 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Dustin Phillip Rouse, an elementary occasional teacher with the Grand Erie DSB, for using a computer to lure a person under 16 for sexual touching. <br><br> Rouse, who was certified to teach in March 2007, represented himself at the January 17, 2013, hearing. <br><br> Between November 2007 and May 2009, Rouse invited a student via computer to view his genitals, perform fellatio, have sexual intercourse and discuss topics such as masturbation, orgasm, bondage and/or sado-masochistic fantasies. He arranged two meetings to have a personal and/or sexual relationship with the student, but they did not occur. <br><br> In June 2009, the Brant County Ontario Provincial Police charged Rouse with Internet luring of a minor. That August, the school board fired him. In June 2011, Rouse pleaded guilty to luring a child via computer for sexual exploitation and for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence, to wit, invitation to sexual touching. He was sentenced in July 2011 to a one-year conditional sentence, including house arrest for six months and three years’ probation. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel and the member, and found Rouse guilty of professional misconduct. The panel ordered the Registrar to revoke Rouse’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “No member of the profession should be engaged in this type of luring and sexually explicit behaviour with a student,” the panel said in its written decision. “It is particularly unacceptable that the member was a teacher, someone who is entrusted with the protection of children. Children are vulnerable members of society and must be safeguarded against predators who use the Internet to lure them into a situation where they can be sexually exploited and abused.” <br><br> ","Member:  Linda Joyce Larocque Registration No:  264264 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of seconded Toronto DSB principal Linda Joyce Larocque for fraudulently misappropriating school funds. <br><br> Larocque, who was certified to teach in October 1975 and retired in 2008, did not attend the January 25, 2013, hearing and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Working as a principal/director of the Bloorview School Authority on secondment from the Toronto DSB, Larocque misappropriated $91,792.75 from the authority between July 2006 and September 2007, according to a Toronto Police Service Financial Crimes Unit audit. Although she retired from the authority in August 2007, Larocque stayed on as a consultant. <br><br> She was charged with fraud over $5,000 and laundering the proceeds of crime. In May 2012, she pleaded guilty to the fraud charge and repaid the $91,792.75 in full. The laundering charge was withdrawn. She also received a conditional sentence of 21 months followed by a year of probation and 200 hours of community service. <br><br> Having examined the evidence and based on a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a guilty plea, a joint submission on resolution, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee ratified the MOA and found Larocque guilty of professional misconduct. The panel directed the Registrar to revoke Larocque’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that while students were not directly involved in Larocque’s misconduct, her actions were “significant enough to cause the school financial challenges and could have seriously impacted the school’s ability to provide quality education for the students. <br><br> “[Larocque’s] actions were a serious breach of trust and brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute.” <br><br> ","Member:  John Andreacchi, OCT Registration No:  434584 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Peel DSB special education teacher John Andreacchi for assaulting a female. <br><br> Andreacchi, who was certified to teach in June 2000, attended the January 30, 2013, hearing with his lawyer. <br><br> Halton Regional Police charged Andreacchi in September 2008 with assault after a female reported that he grabbed her by her wrists and crossed her arms across her neck in an arm hold, causing her to gasp for air. Following a jury trial, he was found guilty of assault and granted a conditional discharge, 12 months’ probation, ordered to pay a $100 fine and perform 60 hours of community service work. He was also ordered to seek assessment and counselling and was prohibited from associating or communicating with the woman except through legal counsel. <br><br> Having been assigned to home with full pay and benefits following the arrest, Andreacchi returned to teach in June 2009. He continues to work for the board. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Andreacchi guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, onus and standard of proof, and legal submissions. <br><br> He was ordered to face the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand. As well, he was ordered to complete courses at his own expense in stress and anger management delivered by a counsellor pre-approved by the Registrar. Within 30 days of completion of the courses, Andreacchi shall deliver directly to the Registrar a written certificate from the course provider stating that he has received a copy of the agreed statement of facts and guilty plea marked as an exhibit at the hearing, and a copy of the decision and reasons of the Discipline Committee, and that he (Andreacchi) has successfully completed the course. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found that the matter was dealt with effectively and appropriately by the criminal courts and that the reprimand and terms, conditions and limitations on Andreacchi’s certificate “appropriately reflect the gravity of the criminal conviction.” <br><br> The panel also considered that it was Andreacchi’s first offence, that he sought counselling and completed anger management training, and that he returned to teaching. <br><br> ","Member:  Marion Ruth Templeton Registration No:  488342 Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Simcoe County DSB teacher Marion Ruth Templeton for forcing a chair from under a student causing him to fall and sprain his wrist. <br><br> Templeton, who was certified to teach in June 2005, attended the January 25, 2013, hearing with her lawyer. <br><br> In November 2010, a student was balancing on a chair on its front legs when, without warning, Templeton came from behind and applied “inappropriate force” to the chair. This caused the student to fall and injure his wrist. As a result, the student had to wear a brace for several weeks afterwards. <br><br> The teacher had previously warned students about the hazards of balancing on their chairs. She apologized to the student, said she never intended him to fall, and reported the incident to the school principal. The Children’s Aid Society investigated and verified that the student suffered physical harm as a result of Templeton’s actions. <br><br> Following board attempts to discipline, which she grieved and got overturned, Templeton completed a 36-hour course in classroom management on her own initiative. <br><br> The Discipline Committee found Templeton guilty of professional misconduct based on a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a guilty plea and submissions from legal counsel. She faced the Discipline Committee panel immediately after the hearing for a reprimand and was ordered to provide the College’s Registrar with written confirmation of the completion of the classroom management and boundaries course within 30 days of the MOA being ratified. <br><br> ","Member:  Lawrence Edgar Keyte Registration No:  285939 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded and suspended OttawaCarleton DSB teacher Lawrence Edgar Keyte for sending inappropriate email communications to a female student. <br><br> Keyte, who was certified to teach in April 1998, attended the February 27, 2013, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel heard evidence that Keyte began a series of email exchanges of a “flirtatious nature” with the student after she sent him a photo of her kissing another girl. Emails between the teacher and student were sent once or twice a month over four months. In one, the girl sent a blackand-white photo of herself covered with bubbles in a bathtub. Keyte did nothing to discourage the student from forwarding such photos or from communicating with him this way. <br><br> The girl’s boyfriend discovered one of the emails between the teacher and student and reported it to the school’s vice-principal. Even so, Keyte created a Gmail account to continue communicating with the girl without using his boardissued email account. Furthermore, he gave her specific instructions about how they could continue to talk in the wake of the boyfriend’s disclosure. <br><br> However, the girl said she began to feel “uncomfortable and gross” about the correspondence after a while and stopped attending school in April 2008, for unrelated reasons, never to return or graduate. In an email sent to apologize for any role his actions might have played in her decision to quit school, Keyte said, “as fun as it was, it was crazy of me to be flirting with a student and to put your sense of ease at school in jeopardy, and to put everything I have at risk. I take total responsibility for it all.” <br><br> Keyte resigned from the board in October 2011. <br><br> The Discipline Committee found Keyte guilty of professional misconduct based on a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest and submissions from legal counsel. He was ordered to face the panel immediately after the hearing for a reprimand and also had his teaching certificate suspended for two years from the date of the hearing. <br><br> Keyte was also ordered to take a course on appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues at his own expense and notify the Registrar within 30 days of its successful completion. <br><br> In its written decision, the Discipline Committee panel said that the member was fully aware of his inappropriate conduct, counselled the student not to speak to anyone about their relationship, and took steps to conceal their correspondence. Further, the panel said that, although there was no evidence of a physical relationship or grooming behaviour, “conduct of this nature cannot be tolerated.” <br><br> ","Member:  Thomas Adrian Foster Registration No:  437682 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended former Toronto DSB teacher Thomas Adrian Foster for three months and ordered him to face a reprimand for inappropriately disciplining students. <br><br> Foster, who was certified to teach in August 2000, represented himself at the March 18, 2013, hearing. <br><br> On several occasions during the 2003–04 school year, Foster held students who had been talking or roughhousing upside down by their feet. He “squished” one student between his arms and carried him, feet off the floor, into the hallway. Another time, he lifted a student over his shoulder and spun him around. <br><br> The board suspended Foster for 10 days in April 2004 without pay for eight incidents of physically mistreating male students. <br><br> Then, between September 2004 and August 2006, while teaching at another school, Foster told students about staff room discussions in which staff members openly spoke about losing their virginity. He shared confidential student information with a parent, told students to shut up, referred to one student as a “moron,” threw erasers at students to get their attention, pulled chairs out from under male students, and sounded a whistle in class to gain students’ attention. Consequently, the board suspended him without pay for two days in April 2006 and then fired him that August. <br><br> Based on the evidence, the statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions of Foster and legal counsel for the College, the Discipline Committee panel found Foster guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The panel ordered the Registrar to suspend Foster’s teaching certificate for three months and ordered him to face the panel after the hearing to be reprimanded. The panel also made it a condition of Foster’s return to teaching that he successfully complete a course on anger management, classroom management and effective student discipline at his own expense and report back to the Registrar within 30 days of having completed the course. <br><br> In its written decision, the Discipline Committee panel noted that, although he had been suspended by his employer previously and had taken a course called “Planning and Professionalism, which included classroom management and professionalism, Foster “continued to physically and verbally abuse students. Further, the member was terminated from his employment in August 2006 for cause.” <br><br> ","Member:  Christopher Paul McLister Registration No:  423036 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Lambton Kent DSB teacher Christopher Paul McLister for engaging in a sexual relationship with a female student. <br><br> McLister, who was certified to teach in February 1999, did not attend the January 31, 2013, hearing, but was represented by his lawyer. <br><br> In March 2008, McLister began a relationship with the student that included communicating via Facebook, sending personal emails and texts, attending the student’s workplace and texting her there repeatedly, inviting her to his apartment and engaging in sexual intercourse. <br><br> In October 2008, he was arrested and charged with one count of sexual assault and one count of touching for a sexual purpose while being in a position of trust or authority. He was released on conditions of release and recognizance with orders to abstain from communicating or associating with the student. But in January 2009, he was arrested and charged with breaching those terms for calls and texts he made to the student between October 2008 and January 3, 2009. <br><br> McLister pleaded to and was found guilty of touching the body of the student for a sexual purpose while in a position of trust or authority toward her in October 2010. The following August, he was sentenced to seven months in jail for the sexual exploitation and 10 days for breach of his conditions of release and recognizance. <br><br> He was fired by the board in November 2008. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found McLister guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said it found McLister’s conduct and its repetitive nature “abhorrent.” <br><br> “The member’s conduct has brought the profession into disrepute,” the panel said. “[He] abused the authority and trust vested in him in his role as a teacher to take advantage of and engage in the sexual abuse of a student.” <br><br> ","Member:  Daniel Richard Thibault Registration No:  519821 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> Former DSB of Niagara teacher Daniel Richard Thibault has had his teaching certificate suspended for three months for conduct related to a criminal charge for loitering/prowling, which was later withdrawn. <br><br> A student neighbour of Thibault’s told police in May 2009 that she was watching television with her boyfriend when she heard leaves rustling outside her partially opened bedroom window. When she turned out the lights and looked outside, she saw a naked male running away from the house. The student called the police and was in the process of making a statement to the investigating officer when Thibault appeared, naked, around the corner of his house. The officer chased and apprehended him. <br><br> In his defence, Thibault said he was in his backyard hot tub when he heard a commotion on the neighbouring property and went to investigate. He said he failed to grab a towel or clothes. On turning the corner of the house, a police officer yelled at him. Startled, he ran back to his hot tub, where he was arrested. <br><br> Niagara Regional Police charged Thibault with “loiter/prowl at night on other person’s property.” In August 2009, the charge was withdrawn and Thibault entered into a 12-month peace bond in which he was ordered not to communicate directly or indirectly with the student. <br><br> In September 2009, the Niagara board fired him and he has not worked as a teacher since. <br><br> In a March 19, 2013, public hearing, a Discipline Committee panel found Thibault guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, the statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty and lawyers’ submissions. <br><br> Thibault, who was certified to teach in April 2007, did not attend the hearing, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel ordered the Registrar to suspend Thibault’s teaching certificate for three months and ordered the member to face the panel to be reprimanded. Prior to his return to teaching, Thibault must provide the Registrar with a doctor’s certificate to approve his return to classroom duties without any undue risk of harm or injury to students or the school community no earlier than 60 days before the intended date of return to work. As well, Thibault must successfully complete a course at his own expense in the ethical responsibilities of teachers. <br><br> ","Member:  Terry (Terence) Paul Baytor Registration No:  156980 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Terry (Terence) Paul Baytor, a former principal with the Toronto DSB, for a criminal conviction for theft. <br><br> Certified in May 1976, Baytor did not attend the March 26, 2013, hearing, nor was he represented by a lawyer. <br><br> Between January 2005 and December 2009, Baytor wrote himself cheques totalling $16,000 from a non-public school account that contained funds from various sources including school fundraising activities and vending machine funds. During that same period, he made only partial deposits into the account, leaving an additional $72,500 unaccounted for. <br><br> On October 11, 2011, Baytor agreed to repay the board $58,400, in complete satisfaction of all amounts misappropriated, mismanaged or otherwise misused by him. <br><br> On November 22, 2011, Baytor pled guilty to theft over $5,000 and was given a conditional sentence for a period of 18 months. He was ordered to be under house arrest for the first 12 months, followed by six months of abiding by a curfew. He was also ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, a memorandum of agreement, a guilty plea and College counsel submissions, the panel found Baytor guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> “The member’s actions were a serious breach of trust and brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute,” the panel said. <br><br> ","Member:  Yves Joly Registration No:  417765 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel found that Yves Joly, a teacher in the Conseil scolaire de district Centre-Sud-Ouest (Conseil scolaire Viamonde), was guilty of professional misconduct for engaging repeatedly in inappropriate conduct mostly relating to the supervision of students and ensuring their safety. <br><br> Joly was certified to teach in August 1998. He was not present at the hearing on March 25, 2013, but was represented by counsel. <br><br> During the 2008–2009 school year, Joly was late without cause more than once, used inappropriate vocabulary in front of students, and failed to meet deadlines relating to report cards and weekly planning. <br><br> The panel also heard evidence that Joly prepared report cards during a teaching period with students and left his classroom for a short period, leaving his Grade 5 students unsupervised. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the agreed statement of facts, the guilty plea and the submissions of counsel, the panel found Joly guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to face the panel for a reprimand. <br><br> He was also ordered to enrol at his own expense within one year of the order in a course on lesson planning, classroom management, student assessment and evaluation and record-keeping. ","Member:  Colin Jeffrey Sawers Registration No:  186522 Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded former Waterloo Region DSB teacher Colin Jeffrey Sawers for unprofessional behaviour with a male student. <br><br> Certified to teach in 1984, he attended the April 18, 2013, hearing and was represented by a lawyer. <br><br> Between 2004 and 2006, Sawers engaged in a series of interactions with a student in his school in which the student initially disclosed his sexual orientation to him. With the permission of the principal and the student’s parents, Sawers became the student’s mentor. <br><br> The parents became concerned when these interactions started to happen outside school hours. In 2004, the principal instructed Sawers not to initiate contact with the student outside school property, and later directed him not to have further contact with the student as a mentor. <br><br> Despite the principal’s direction, Sawers continued to interact with the student electronically, meet him socially outside of school and discuss the student’s sexuality. The parents gave the teacher permission for some of these interactions. <br><br> In 2006, the principal provided the member with a letter of discipline reinforcing that Sawers was expected to maintain professional relationships with all students in the school. Sawers subsequently resigned his College membership and signed an undertaking not to seek reinstatement. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, the statement of uncontested facts, the plea of no contest, and the representations by counsel, the panel found Sawers guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to face the panel after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> ","Member:  Stephen Edward Fletcher Registration No:  253471 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Stephen Edward Fletcher, a teacher with the Halton DSB, for engaging in an inappropriate and unprofessional personal relationship with a female student, which culminated in a criminal conviction for sexual exploitation. <br><br> Certified to teach in 1991, he attended the February 26, 2013, hearing and was self-represented. <br><br> From April 2010 to January 2011, Fletcher developed a “dating relationship” with a student, which included exchanging phone numbers, kissing, introducing her to his daughter, and sharing family activities such as cooking and movie nights. The student’s mother specifically requested that he end the relationship and, despite agreeing, he did not. <br><br> In August 2011, Fletcher pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation and was sentenced to a 14-day intermittent jail sentence and 18 months of probation. <br><br> The member argued that he recognized that he had made a mistake and stated that he did not think that kissing was considered sexual abuse. He explained that the student ate her lunch with teachers, appeared more comfortable with adults than with her peers and was easy to talk to. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel was not convinced that the member had a full understanding of the importance of respecting student-teacher boundaries and that he continued to try to justify his actions by referring to the maturity of the student. “It is unlikely that a teacher with 20 years of experience would not be aware that this conduct was unprofessional and unbecoming of a member of the profession, especially given the fact that the student’s mother requested that he end the relationship,” the panel said in its written decision. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and submissions made by College counsel and the member, the panel found Fletcher guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> ","Member:  Yusuf Ali Talukder Registration No:  474890 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered that the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Toronto private school principal Yusuf Ali Talukder be revoked in connection with a criminal conviction for sexual assault and sexual interference involving a 13-year-old student. <br><br> Talukder, who was certified in May 2005, was not present or represented at the March 26, 2013, hearing. <br><br> In November 2007, Talukder sexually touched a 13-year-old girl whom he was tutoring at the school, resulting in criminal charges and a court finding in May 2010 of guilt in touching a person under 14 for sexual purposes and for sexual assault. He was sentenced to six months in jail followed by three years’ probation. Further, he was prohibited for 10 years from attending a public park, swimming area, daycare centre, school ground, playground or community centre where anyone under 16 is present; using a computer system to communicate with anyone under 16; or seeking paid employment or a volunteer position that involves being in a position of trust or authority toward anyone under 16. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Talukder guilty of professional misconduct. The panel ordered the Registrar to revoke Talukder’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> ","Member:  Stewart Montague Adams Registration No:  100893 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Stewart Montague Adams after hearing allegations of professional misconduct related to criminal convictions for accessing, possessing and making available child pornography between February and June 2010. <br><br> A teacher with the Toronto DSB, Adams was certified to teach in 1994. He did not attend the May 22, 2013, hearing and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In January 2012, Adams pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was sentenced to 53 months in jail and three years probation. <br><br> College counsel submitted that Adams had amassed a shockingly vast amount of child pornography. In total, there were 192,327 images of children, 677 child pornography videos and 37 child pornography movies. He had made his collection available to broader distribution via a peer-to-peer network. <br><br> The court prohibited him from the following for 20 years:  <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and submissions made by College counsel, the panel found Adams guilty of professional misconduct and revoked his certificate. <br><br> The committee found that accessing, possessing and making available child pornography are among the most heinous crimes in our society, targeting children and perpetuating a market that thrives on the exploitation and abuse of children. <br><br> ","Member:  Brian Douglas Jones Registration No:  483060 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Brian Douglas Jones after conducting a hearing into allegations of professional misconduct related to criminal convictions for sexual exploitation and obstructing justice. <br><br> Jones was certified to teach in 2004. He did not attend the May 29, 2013, hearing and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In October 2012, Jones pleaded guilty to criminal charges of sexual exploitation and obstructing justice in relation to his conduct toward a female student between January 2005 and December 2006. <br><br> Jones was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail and prohibited from the following for 20 years:  <br><br> The evidence presented at the hearing confirmed that Jones provided the student with cigarettes, used marijuana and consumed alcohol with her, and had an ongoing sexual relationship with her.

He was present at the hearing on May 16, 2013, and was represented by counsel. <br><br> During the 2006–08 school years, Ajab had a poor understanding of certain mathematical concepts and failed to effectively teach the subject. He failed to assist students who requested assistance and advised students not to participate in remedial mathematics classes offered by other teachers. <br><br> The discipline panel also heard evidence that Ajab used inappropriate language in the classroom, yelled at students and said to one that the student was stupid and an idiot. Ajab also demonstrated intimidating behaviour by slamming books down on his desk, kicking desks and slamming a door on a student’s hand. <br><br> Based on the evidence, the agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea and counsel submissions, the panel found Ajab guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to appear before a panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> Furthermore, he was ordered to enrol at his own expense in a course on maintaining boundaries within 12 months of the order. <br><br> ","Member:  Christopher Andrew Forrest Registration No:  433214 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of former DSB of Niagara teacher Christopher Andrew Forrest for sexual exploitation of a student. <br><br> Forrest, who was certified in March 2000, was not present or represented at the hearing on July 25, 2013. <br><br> For six months during the 2010–11 academic year, Forrest engaged in an inappropriate personal and sexual relationship with a 16-year-old female student. The relationship began through chatting on Facebook, progressed to intimate conversations, followed by kissing and touching, and culminated in intercourse on three occasions. All incidents occurred in Forrest’s classroom before the school day started. <br><br> On August 7, 2012, Forrest pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation by engaging in a sexual relationship with a student while he was in a position of trust and authority. He was sentenced to 12 months in jail, followed by two years of probation. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Forrest guilty of professional misconduct. The panel ordered the Registrar to revoke Forrest’s Certification of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member engaged in reprehensible conduct unbecoming a member of the teaching profession,” the panel said in its written decision. “This conduct is unacceptable and betrays the teacher’s obligation to protect his students. The member abused the public trust in an egregious manner and has therefore lost the right to teach. Revocation is the penalty that is required in this case.” <br><br> Revocation serves as both a specific and general deterrent as removing the member from the classroom protects students and restores public confidence in the profession. Publication with name advises the profession that misconduct, which breaches the teacher-student boundary and violates the trust and authority vested in teachers, will result in significant consequences. <br><br> “The committee (panel) is satisfied that the finding and penalty protect the public interest and uphold the standards of the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Reid David MacIntosh Innes, OCT Registration No:  479818 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded former Greater Essex County DSB teacher Reid David MacIntosh Innes for stealing $33 from a locked drawer in the school office. <br><br> Innes, who was certified to teach in May 2004, did not attend the hearing on June 17, 2013, but was represented by a lawyer. <br><br> Video surveillance captured Innes using a key to remove a total of $33 from a locked drawer in the school’s office over five days. Innes resigned from the board in June 2011 on the same day he was suspended without pay and told there would be a recommendation to end his employment. That November, Innes sent the board a letter and a cheque for $100 as restitution. <br><br> He said he regretted his conduct, that it was out-of-character, a mistake and that he was experiencing financial difficulties at the time. Police were never involved in the investigation and no charges were laid. <br><br> Having examined the evidence and based on a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a guilty plea, a joint submission on resolution, and the submissions of counsel, the Discipline Committee panel ratified the MOA and found Innes guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> He was ordered to face the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand. He was also ordered to take an ethical behaviour course at his own expense within 120 days of the MOA being ratified, and to provide written proof from the course provider that he has successfully completed the course within 30 days of finishing. <br><br> “In the committee’s view, the member breached the standards of the profession and engaged in conduct unbecoming a member of the teaching profession. The committee agreed that a reprimand and the imposition of terms, conditions and limitations on the member’s certificate is an appropriate resolution for conduct of this nature,” the panel said in its written decision. <br><br> “The committee accepts that the member indicated that this was an isolated occurrence; he was experiencing financial difficulties at the time and had never previously engaged in the same or similar conduct nor has since.” <br><br> ","Member:  William Hodgson Marshall Registration No:  383504 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of William Hodgson Marshall after hearing allegations of professional misconduct related to criminal convictions for one count of sexual assault and 16 counts of indecent assault of minors from 1952 to 1986. <br><br> Certified to teach in July 1948, Marshall was employed as a teacher and principal at an independent Toronto Catholic school, the Windsor Essex Catholic DSB and the Sudbury Catholic DSB at different times when the offences occurred, over many years. <br><br> He did not attend the hearing on June 4, 2013, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In June 2011, Marshall pleaded guilty to criminal charges and was sentenced to two years, imprisonment, to be served concurrently, and three years’ probation for each count. <br><br> Court documents, including victim impact statements, revealed that Marshall engaged in a long series of incidents of sexual touching of his students from 1952 to 1986 while he was a priest and employed as a teacher and principal. These assaults occurred in many locations, including in the rectory, in schools, school showers, in dormitories, in Marshall’s office, in the students’ homes when adults were present in other parts of the house, and at recreational locations such as his cottage. In some cases, the students, who were between the ages of 7 and 16, were subjected to these assaults regularly over long periods. Marshall often used physical force, confinement and the administration of alcohol to effect his predations. He warned the students that if they told anyone he would fail them or have them removed from the school. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and submissions made by legal counsel, the panel found Marshall guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his certificate be revoked. <br><br> The committee found that Marshall had brought shame and disrepute to the profession through his abuse of power and sexual exploitation of students, and that such behaviour can only be characterized as reprehensible, debauched and entirely shameful. <br><br> ","Member:  Stephen Alexander Martin Registration No:  419301 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Stephen Alexander Martin after hearing allegations of professional misconduct related to criminal convictions for luring a child via computer for sexual exploitation and making child pornography between June 2009 and April 2011. <br><br> A former elementary teacher with the Durham DSB, Martin was certified to teach in 1998. He did not attend the hearing on June 4, 2013, and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In December 2011, Martin was found guilty of 10 criminal charges of luring a child via computer for sexual exploitation and one criminal charge of making child pornography. He was sentenced to two years less a day in jail and three years’ probation. <br><br> College counsel submitted that Martin had amassed a total of 3,374 pictures and 582 movies that constituted child pornography. <br><br> Martin actively preyed on his students by posing as a 13-year-old female student. He would encourage them to befriend him on Facebook and MSN and then ask them to expose their genitals on a webcam. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the panel found Martin guilty of professional misconduct and ordered his certificate to be revoked. <br><br> “Targeting and luring children and perpetuating a market for child pornography that thrives on the exploitation and abuse of children is a crime that is most heinous,” the panel said. <br><br> ","Member:  Gilles Michaud Registration No:  170253 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Rainbow DSB elementary teacher Gilles Michaud for physically and verbally abusing five of his students between 2003 and 2009. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in 1984, attended the hearing on August 20, 2013, and pleaded guilty to professional misconduct and acknowledged he behaved inappropriately. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that in February 2003, the member kicked a female student in the leg. In November 2007, he pushed another student on the stairs, injuring his side. The Children’s Aid Society investigated the incidents and confirmed they had taken place. The member received a letter of warning from the school administration and was suspended for 15 days. Michaud was also required to take an anger management course, which he did. <br><br> In spite of the warning, the member continued to behave inappropriately. The panel heard that between January and September 2009, Michaud called two students “idiots” and threw a pair of shoes at a male student during a gym class. One shoe bounced off the floor, hitting the student in the face. The Children’s Aid Society was called and the school board terminated Michaud’s employment. <br><br> Having examined the evidence and based on a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), a guilty plea, a joint submission on resolution, and submissions from legal counsel, the panel found Michaud guilty of professional misconduct and ratified the MOA. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel issued a reprimand and imposed conditions, terms and limitations on his certificate. Before seeking employment requiring a Certificate of Qualification and Registration from the College, the member must complete a pre-approved course in classroom management at his own expense and submit written proof to the College that the course was completed successfully. In addition, the decision with the member’s name will be published in the College’s official publication, Professionally Speaking/Pour parler profession. <br><br> “Publication, with the member’s name, acts as a specific deterrent to the member and as a general deterrent to the profession from engaging in similar misconduct,” said the panel. <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded an Avon Maitland DSB teacher for failing to maintain the standards of the profession and using inappropriate discipline strategies with a student. <br><br> The member, who was certified in June 1982, was present at the hearing on May 24, 2013, with his lawyer. <br><br> In September 2009, the member confronted a student, grabbed his backpack and exchanged words with him after the student refused to go to the vice-principal’s office as instructed. As the student proceeded to walk down the hallway, the member continued to block his way and, at one point, shoved him into a wall or locker in the hallway. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel. <br><br> He was ordered to face the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand. The Discipline Committee panel ordered the Registrar to impose terms and conditions on the member’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration. Prior to returning to a teaching position, the member must complete a pre-approved course, at his own expense, regarding positive discipline strategies and classroom management, and report to the Registrar within 30 days of successfully completing it. The notation of the reprimand will remain on the member’s certificate for three years. <br><br> ","Member:  John Daniel Montpellier, OCT Registration No:  598763 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded John Daniel Montpellier for physically abusing a student while employed as a probationary teacher at the Sudbury Catholic DSB and ordered him to take a classroom management course before working as a teacher again. <br><br> Montpellier, who was certified to teach in September 2010, attended the hearing on June 13, 2013, with his lawyer. <br><br> In December 2011, Montpellier dragged a student across the classroom floor and then shook him by one or both ankles when he grabbed onto a door frame. He admitted grabbing the student by the ankles, but denied shaking him. In November 2011, Montpellier stood in front of another student with a stick in his hand and then placed the stick behind his back in such a way as to indicate he was going to hit the student. <br><br> The school district dismissed Montpellier for cause in February 2012. <br><br> The Sudbury Children’s Aid Society investigated and notified police. The police charged Montpellier with three counts of assault, but the charges were withdrawn in April 2012 when the matter was resolved with a peace bond. <br><br> Montpellier was not working in the teaching profession at the time of this decision. <br><br> Having examined the evidence, and based on a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a guilty plea, a joint submission on resolution, and the submissions of counsel, the Discipline Committee panel ratified the MOA and found Montpellier guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> He was ordered to face the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand. He was also ordered to take a classroom management course at his own expense and provide written proof of its successful completion before seeking work as a certified teacher. <br><br> “The reprimand will remind the member of his responsibilities to ensure the welfare of his students and reinforce the standard of the profession prohibiting teachers from using physical force with students,” the panel said in its written decision. “The course in classroom management will rehabilitate the member and provide strategies for successfully dealing with students.” <br><br> ","Member:  Jask Ramburn Registration No:  104709 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered that the certificate of Toronto private school teacher Jask Ramburn be revoked in connection with a criminal conviction for assault of an 8-year-old girl. <br><br> Ramburn, who was certified in July 1972, was not present or represented at the hearing on April 23, 2013. <br><br> Late in 2009, Ramburn initiated physical contact with an 8-year-old girl outside the school setting. This resulted in criminal charges and a court finding in June 2011 of guilt in assaulting a person under 14. Physical contacts included hugging the child tightly, cradling her, swinging her around in his arms and placing his hands on her shoulders. The panel heard that the physical contact “made the student uncomfortable and was not consensual.” <br><br> Ramburn asked her to keep the physical contact between them a secret as the parents repeatedly told him not to initiate any physical contact with their child. <br><br> Ramburn was given a conditional sentence of three months and was placed on probation for 21 months. Further, he was prohibited from having any contact with anyone under the age of 12 unless accompanied by an adult. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Ramburn guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that Ramburn’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> In their written decision, the panel recognized that the member was convicted of assault saying, “This is a serious breach of trust involving a vulnerable child. Revocation protects the public interest as it protects student safety.” <br><br> ","Member:  Andrew James Ritchie Registration No:  481605 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Peel DSB teacher Andrew James Ritchie for harassing a colleague and failing to maintain the standards of the profession. <br><br> Ritchie, who was certified in July 2004, attended the hearing on June 17, 2013, with his lawyer. <br><br> Ritchie was involved in a consensual sexual relationship with a female colleague for about three years until May 2010. When the relationship ended, he tried to communicate with her through text messages, emails, notes, other colleagues and following her to her car at the school. On multiple occasions, he became verbally and emotionally abusive to her, sending offensive text messages in which he used explicit and vulgar language, and which his colleague considered threatening. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Ritchie guilty of professional misconduct based on a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a guilty plea and submissions of legal counsel. <br><br> He was ordered to face the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand. The Discipline Committee panel also ordered Ritchie to take, at his own expense, a pre-approved course or counselling in harassment and professional boundaries within 90 days of the ratification of the MOA, and report to the Registrar within 30 days of successfully completing it. <br><br> The committee found that the member failed to maintain the standards of the profession and engaged in conduct unbecoming a member of the profession by acting in a verbally and emotionally abusive manner toward a colleague.","Member:  Alexander Clachers Registration No:  286959 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Alexander Clachers, a teacher with the Kawartha Pine Ridge DSB, in connection with a criminal conviction for sexual interference, sexual assault and sexual exploitation of seven victims between the ages of 11 and 20. Five of Clacher’s victims were his current and former students. <br><br> Clachers, who was certified to teach in 1998, did not attend the hearing on September 18, 2013, and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> From 2004 and 2009, the member worked as a Grade 9–12 secondary school teacher. During his employment, Clachers sexually assaulted, exploited and interfered with four male students and one female student. These activities included his inviting students to spend the night at his house, making inappropriate sexual remarks, and repeatedly touching his students’ buttocks and genitals. These assaults happened in the classroom, at the member’s house, in a hotel and elsewhere in the community. <br><br> In October 2009, a Superior Court of Justice jury found Clachers guilty of 15 sex offences, which included seven counts of sexual assault, seven counts of sexual exploitation and one count of sexual interference. He was criminally convicted and, in October 2010, the court sentenced Clachers to 10 years in a federal prison. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel agreed with Superior Court Justice Corkery’s statement that “Adult sexual predators who would put the lives of innocent children at risk in order to satisfy their deviant sexual needs must know that they will pay a heavy price.” <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and submissions of College counsel, the panel found Clachers guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> ","Member:  William Clarke Registration No:  247756 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Peel DSB vice-principal William Clarke for pursuing and engaging in personal and physical relationships with a school employee, a teacher and a student. Clarke also used a school computer to view dating, chat and pornographic websites. <br><br> Clarke, who was certified to teach in 1983, did not attend the hearing on September 24, 2013, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, between 2007 and 2009, Clarke used his position of authority and trust to prey on three females who were particularly vulnerable. When they turned to Clarke for professional advice, personal guidance or assistance, he exploited his position as vice-principal to begin a process of seduction. <br><br> For example, in 2008, a student at the school approached Clarke when she “needed help” and “didn’t know where else to turn.” Within weeks of their first conversation, Clarke regularly pulled the student out of class to talk, made flirtatious remarks and began sending her “a litany” of sexually charged emails. Shortly after she graduated, they had intercourse twice in Clarke’s car and once at the school. <br><br> The panel also heard evidence that Clarke pursued a personal relationship with a young teacher preparing for the principal’s qualification program, and a personal and physical relationship with a part-time staff member who was new to the school. In both cases, there was an escalation of contact. Inappropriate sexual comments led to attempts at physical contact, and much to the staff member’s regret, sexual activity. The teacher and the staff member reported Clarke’s behaviour to the board, saying they were uncomfortable with the unwanted attention but “felt trapped,” “powerless” and didn’t want to jeopardize their jobs or careers. As a result of the complaints, the board investigated the matter. Clarke resigned in June 2009 prior to the school board meeting to fire him. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions by College counsel, the panel found Clarke guilty of professional misconduct and ordered his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that a member “who abuses, to this level, a position of authority and responsibility ceases to maintain the privilege of teaching.” <br><br> ","Member:  Hugues Joseph Marcel Latour Registration No:  510227 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Hugues Latour for grooming and subsequently having sexual intercourse with a student, which resulted in the birth of a child. <br><br> Latour was certified to teach in Ontario in 2007. At the time of the allegations, he was employed in the Northwest Territories (NWT) where he held an interim professional teaching certificate. The matter came before the College on January 22, 2013, and continued on June 3, 2013. Latour did not attend the hearings, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that Latour engaged in grooming behaviour to initiate a close and inappropriate relationship with a female student. During the 2009 school year, he encouraged the student to join activities he supervised and to participate in a three- or four-night field trip together. He gave her private tutorials and allowed her to work alone in his classroom. Shortly after she graduated, Latour invited her to his apartment where they drank wine and began a sexual relationship. The relationship continued and the student subsequently gave birth to the member’s son. <br><br> In August 2010, a hearing committee of the NWT Ministry of Education found Latour guilty of professional misconduct and instructed the Registrar to cancel his NWT teaching certificate. Latour appealed the committee’s decision in December 2012, long after the 30-day time limit to submit an appeal had passed. The committee rejected his request for a new hearing. <br><br> In its written finding, the NWT committee stated, “There cannot be a distinction between a sexual relationship that occurs two weeks before graduation between a teacher and a student, and a sexual relationship that occurs two weeks after graduation between the same two people.” The Ontario College of Teachers’ Discipline Committee agreed with the NWT committee’s finding, adding that the member’s behaviour was proof of “flagrant negligence with respect to the risk and danger to which he exposed the student.” <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and submissions of College counsel, the panel found Latour guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> ","Member:  Allester Gerard Ashley Macedo Registration No:  206895 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered that the certificate of Dufferin-Peel Catholic DSB teacher Allester Macedo be revoked for sexually abusing a student while they were in the classroom. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in 1995, attended the public hearing on October 16, 2013, and was self-represented. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that in May 2009, Macedo supervised an in-class test during the last school period. When the bell rang, most students handed in their tests and left. About 10 students, who needed additional time, stayed behind, including a female student who was struggling academically. As the remaining students finished the test, they also exited until only Macedo, the female student and one of her classmates were left in the classroom. <br><br> At this point, Macedo approached the female student and pinched and kissed her cheek. After the second student left, Macedo kissed the female student a number of times, hugged her, and ran his hand down quickly toward her backside. Macedo told the student that he loved her and asked if she loved him. After the exchange, the student left the class, almost an hour after the school day had ended. In the hallway, Macedo told the student that what had happened was their secret. <br><br> Regional police subsequently charged Macedo with sexual assault and sexual exploitation. In February 2011, a criminal court found Macedo guilty and sentenced him to 90 days in jail and two years of probation for sexual exploitation. A conditional stay was entered with respect to the charge of sexual assault. In May 2012, a Superior Court of Justice dismissed Macedo’s appeal of the conviction and sentence. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel and the member, the panel found Macedo guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> “Despite being found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the member continues to deny any transgression,” wrote the panel. “Revocation serves as both a specific and general deterrent as removing the member from the classroom protects students and restores public confidence in the profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Name withheld Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded a Peel DSB teacher for speaking to and treating students inappropriately. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in 1976, attended the public hearing on September 30, 2013, with legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that in February and March 2009, the member made inappropriate comments in class, including calling his students “idiots” and “low-life.” The school board and school administrators met with the member to discuss his behaviour and gave him a letter of discipline requiring him to undergo sensitivity training, which he completed in April 2009. <br><br> In June 2011, the school board met with the member again about his classroom behaviour, for reading student marks out publicly and saying “this person is not going to go anywhere.” He also told his class he didn’t care if they failed as he got a raise each year. When students weren’t listening to his lesson, the member yelled at them, threw chalk and pencils, and walked out of the classroom in frustration. The member received a second letter of discipline and completed two courses on classroom management and boundaries. <br><br> Having examined the evidence and based on a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a plea of no contest, a joint submission on resolution, and submissions from legal counsel, the panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ratified the MOA. It determined that a reprimand was the appropriate penalty, accepting that the member had retired from the profession in 2012 and this was the first time in a 35-year career he faced allegations of professional misconduct. <br><br> In its written statement, the panel noted, “The reprimand by his peers, will inform the member that his conduct was unacceptable and inappropriate while reinforcing the importance of maintaining the highest standards of the profession.” The panel further stated, “The profession will be made aware that similar conduct is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.” <br><br> ","Member:  Kenneth John J. O’Keefe Registration No:  355795 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Ottawa Catholic SB secondary school teacher Kenneth John J. O’Keefe for sexually abusing a male student. <br><br> O’Keefe, who joined the teaching profession in 1955, did not attend the hearing on August 27, 2013, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> From September 1 to December 1, 1974, O’Keefe was the student’s homeroom teacher and a member of the order of the Basilian Fathers. During that time, the student had an argument with his parents and spoke to O’Keefe about it. O’Keefe, who had always told his students that he was available if they needed someone to talk to, invited the student to stay overnight at his home. When the student arrived, there was only one bed. Although the student said he would sleep on the floor, the member encouraged him to share the bed. That night, the student awoke to find the member lying naked beside him, pushing his penis between the student’s underwear and buttocks. At the same time, O’Keefe was touching the student’s genitals. <br><br> In September 2012, in criminal court, O’Keefe pleaded guilty to and was convicted of indecent assault. He was given a ninemonth conditional sentence, which included six months of house arrest. In addition, the court prohibited the member, for life, from being in the presence of anyone under the age of 16. This included seeking volunteer or employment opportunities where he might be in a position of trust or authority, and from using a computer system to communicate with anyone under 16. The member has not appealed the conviction or the sentence. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of counsel, the panel found O’Keefe guilty of professional misconduct and ordered his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. The panel agreed that full publication with name was warranted and necessary. <br><br> While the incident occurred 39 years ago and the member is long retired, “Sexual assault on a student is considered to be one of the most severe types of professional misconduct and the committee should communicate strongly that this behaviour will not be tolerated,” said the panel in its written decision. <br><br> “General deterrence remains an important consideration,” they continued. “Teachers must know that they are held to a very high standard and that failure to adhere to the standard will result in the College’s most severe penalty.” <br><br> ","Member:  Jacques René Joseph Perron Registration No:  104771 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered that the certificate of former principal of the Conseil scolaire de district catholique des Aurores boréales, Jacques René Joseph Perron, be revoked. <br><br> Perron was certified to teach in 1990. He attended the hearings between November 21, 2011, and August 7, 2013, and was represented by legal counsel. He pleaded not guilty to the allegations brought against him. <br><br> Perron faced seven allegations of professional misconduct related to his repeated abuse of authority, lack of judgment and disregard for the welfare of his students. Specifically, he failed to notify the Children’s Aid Society that Pierre Grondin, a school employee, sexually abused an intellectually challenged male student over several years. The panel heard evidence that Perron repeatedly ignored allegations of abuse from parents and staff. For example, the school bus driver informed Perron she overheard students saying they had seen Grondin naked on a class field trip. A week later, he lied to her about investigating the matter and said that “nothing serious occurred.” In addition to deliberately “turning a blind eye” to protect Grondin, the panel heard that Perron allowed him to continue working despite reports of Grondin’s chronic absenteeism, sleeping on the job and use of abusive language toward other staff members. <br><br> Between June 2003 and March 2006, Perron mismanaged school funds and records, and “fostered a climate of intimidation, manipulation, retaliation, threats and criticism with respect to staff members, school board members, parents and students.” For example, staff members were actively discouraged from registering complaints and described the school as having “an absolutely toxic and unbearable atmosphere.” The supervisory officer for the school board reported major shortcomings in the school’s administration including student access to pornographic sites via school computers, unfair hiring practices, and incomplete criminal record checks and staff evaluations. Furthermore, Perron claimed expenses during a paid leave of absence and approved significant hours of overtime to favourite staff members saying that “the Ministry of Education always makes up the deficits.” <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of counsel, the panel found Perron guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> ","Member:  Randy Stuart Ward Registration No:  449418 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions, suspension (if conditions are not met) <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic DSB teacher Randy Ward for talking to and physically touching female students inappropriately. <br><br> Ward was certified to teach in 2001. He attended hearings on November 6, 7, 8 and December 18, 2012, and was represented by legal counsel. Ward also attended the penalty hearing on September 16, 2013. <br><br> During the 2008–09 school year, Ward often allowed his current and former students to hang out in his classroom to socialize. This involved four female students who were in his class or who stopped by frequently to talk to him. Witnesses testified that, on several occasions, Ward called them “sexy,” “beautiful” and “pretty,” hugged them, and touched or tapped them on or near their buttocks. On Valentine’s Day, he presented one of the students with a rose and cookies. Ward’s behaviour made the students feel uncomfortable to the point where they reported the incidents to the school youth worker. The school board fired Ward in September 2009. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that Ward displayed a “serious lack of professional judgment” and clearly breached appropriate teacher-student boundaries. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of legal counsel, the panel found Ward guilty of professional misconduct. Ward was ordered to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand and to complete, at his own expense, two courses covering classroom management, appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues. These courses must be pre-approved by the Registrar. If Ward fails to fulfill these terms, conditions or limitations within 150 days of the date of the written penalty decision, the Registrar is directed to suspend his Certificate of Qualification and Registration for three months.","Member:  Aaron Weston Michael Aird Registration No:  564130 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Waterloo Catholic DSB teacher Aaron Weston Michael Aird for engaging in a sexual relationship with a student. <br><br> Aird was not present or legally represented at the November 22, 2013, hearing. <br><br> Prior to being certified to teach in August 2009, Aird was a student teacher who was hired by a mother to tutor her daughter twice a week. He was 28 at the time and in his second year of teachers’ college. A sexual relationship between Aird and the student began in November 2008 with sexual touching, and progressed to oral sex and then sexual intercourse. The tutoring stopped in February 2009, but the sexual relationship continued until March 2010 when a friend persuaded the student to go to the police. Aird was charged in March 2010 with two counts of sexual exploitation resulting in a criminal conviction of sexual exploitation and sexual touching, and a sentence of 12 months in jail and 12 months of probation. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the panel found Aird guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel called Aird’s conduct “reprehensible” and said that his abuse of the public trust warranted his forfeiting the privilege of holding a teaching certificate. <br><br> ","Member:  Vincenzo De Petrillo Registration No:  251339 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded York Region Catholic DSB teacher Vincenzo De Petrillo for slapping a student for swearing. <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1983, De Petrillo attended the January 16, 2014, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In October 2009, De Petrillo struck a student on the face with an open hand because he did not like that the student swore while talking with a peer. As a result, De Petrillo was charged that November with assault and in December 2010 was criminally convicted. He was granted a conditional discharge, placed on nine months probation and required to perform 20 hours of community service within six months of the conviction. <br><br> Based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions of legal counsel, the panel found De Petrillo guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to receive a reprimand from the panel immediately following the hearing. De Petrillo must also complete a course of instruction in boundary issues and violations, pre-approved by the Registrar, and provide the Registrar with written confirmation of its successful completion. <br><br> The reprimand serves as a specific deterrent and enables the member to consider his future actions, while the coursework serves a rehabilitative need by providing the member with strategies to manage the classroom effectively, the panel said in its written decision. <br><br> ","Member:  Peter Jeffrey Floro Registration No:  280810 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Toronto DSB secondary school teacher Peter Jeffrey Floro for inappropriate communication with students, including inappropriate electronic communications, comments of a sexual nature and sexually abusing a student. <br><br> Floro, who was certified to teach in November 1998, did not attend the January 21, 2014, hearing, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, in the academic years between 2008 and 2010, Floro engaged in inappropriate communications with students, including sexualized comments. In June 2010, Floro kissed and touched a student sexually at his home. <br><br> Based on the evidence, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions of legal counsel, the panel found Floro guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that Floro “abused his position as a teacher by having inappropriate communications with four students, one of which culminated in sexual contact.” <br><br> ","Member:  John Courtney Knollys Folkes Registration No:  148173 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered Toronto DSB teacher John Courtney Knollys Folkes to receive a reprimand for erratic and unacceptable behaviour. <br><br> Folkes, who was certified to teach in June 1985, did not attend the November 5, 2013, hearing nor was he represented. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, in October 2006, Folkes threw chairs and kicked them into the school’s hallway, swore in front of students and the school, belittled support staff, and demanded service that was personal and inappropriate. He also had a fixation about a parking spot he claimed was his, and that he harassed other teachers about using it, including threatening legal action. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the panel found Folkes guilty of professional misconduct. He was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. Further, he was ordered to successfully complete a course of instruction in anger management pre-approved by the Registrar, at his own expense, prior to seeking or engaging in employment requiring a Certificate of Qualification and Registration in Ontario. He must provide the Registrar with written confirmation of his successful completion of this course and a psychiatrist’s assessment determining suitability to return to teaching. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said the member “displayed outbursts, both verbal and through his actions, inimical to an educational setting. <br><br> “The member created a culture of fear in his school as he let go of his inhibitions to achieve some form of justice as he saw it,” the panel wrote. “[He] was completely unaware of the impact that he was having on other persons in the school. This is not the way a teacher should function.” <br><br> ","Member:  Orlando Franco Fusaro Registration No:  419370 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Toronto Catholic DSB teacher Orlando Franco Fusaro for grooming a student for a sexual relationship. <br><br> Fusaro, who was certified to teach in June 1998, did not attend the December 12, 2013, hearing nor was he represented. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, during the 2010–11 school year, Fusaro moved the female student’s desk next to his during class, revealed personal aspects of his domestic relationship, exchanged hundreds of emails of a personal and sexual nature, and commented on the student’s physical attributes. During a playful event in a park in June 2011, Fusaro grabbed the student’s buttocks, which resulted in a charge and conviction of sexual interference. He pleaded guilty to one count of sexual interference and received a 10-day intermittent jail sentence, 100 hours of community service and three years of probation. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the panel found Fusaro guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member abused the public trust in a disgraceful manner and has forfeited the privilege of holding a teaching certificate,” the panel said in its written decision. <br><br> ","Member:  Darcy Douglas Jack Registration No:  427549 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of former Rainy River DSB teacher Darcy Douglas Jack for voyeurism. <br><br> Jack, who was certified to teach in November 2000, did not attend nor was he represented at the December 12, 2013, hearing. <br><br> In February 2008, while two former students were babysitting his children, Jack secretly filmed them showering and performing their bathroom rituals in his unfinished basement bathroom. A camera he had installed was directed at a shower and toilet stall and the students were unaware they were being watched and taped. The images were recorded on a rented laptop. Upon its return, a rental store employee discovered the images and alerted the police. <br><br> Jack was subsequently charged in April 2008 and pleaded guilty that August to voyeurism, for which he received a conditional sentence of 90 days and 12 months’ probation. He resigned from the Rainy River board in August 2008. <br><br> Based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions of College counsel, the panel found Jack guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member, by videotaping intimate acts of students in the bathroom of his home breached the public trust and the sense of public decency,” the panel said. “[He] used his position of trust as a teacher in a small community to abuse students. Revocation is the fitting consequence.” <br><br> ","Member:  James Michael Kowal Registration No:  153742 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended Kawartha Pine Ridge DSB occasional teacher James Michael Kowal for three months and ordered him to face a reprimand for failing to follow proper dismissal procedures and leaving two Junior Kindergarten students unattended in a school playground in winter. <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1971, Kowal did not attend the December 11, 2013, hearing nor was he represented. <br><br> Despite being provided information on dismissal routines and having access to clearly posted general practices in the classroom, Kowal left school at the end of the day on December 3, 2010, leaving two students, who had missed the bus, unsupervised in the cold schoolyard. The mother of one of the boys testified that her son required several days of reassurance afterwards that school was a safe place to attend. Following an investigation, Kowal received a disciplinary letter from the board on March 15, 2011, and, having received previous reminders, was suspended without pay until March 31, 2011. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and College counsel submissions, the panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct, ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for three months and that he appear before the panel to receive a reprimand before returning to teaching in Ontario. <br><br> In addition, Kowal was ordered to complete a course of instruction in classroom management and teacher accountability at his own expense, pre-approved by the Registrar. Within 15 days of returning to work, Kowal must provide the Registrar with proof of the date he commenced or resumed employment, and that he has made his employer aware of the Discipline Committee’s decision, including the reprimand and conditions. <br><br> “The Education Act is clear on the role and responsibilities of teachers, ensuring the safety of students under their care. This includes supervision and safe dismissal,” the panel said in its written decision. <br><br> Kowal’s failure to follow the daily plan regarding the dismissal routine or board policy resulted in “disgraceful, dishonourable and definitely unprofessional” behaviour, the panel said. Further, his behaviour “constituted psychological or emotional abuse of a student or students.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered a College member to receive a reprimand for using inappropriate language in dealing with a student and personally moving the student’s desk. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in May 2003, attended the December 20, 2013, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> In April 2010, while helping one student, the member was repeatedly interrupted by another asking for help. The member told the second student that, had she paid attention in class, she would have known what to do and that she’d have to wait until she was finished helping the first student. When the member finally offered help, the student refused. On separate occasions in May 2010, the member raised her voice to the same student, who did not want to listen to the member, and called the girl a “spoiled brat” when she didn’t get her way in class. The student talked back to the member and started to play with things inside her desk as she was leaning on top of it. The member turned the student’s desk around so that it was facing opposite the student. The student attempted to turn the desk back toward her with her feet and almost fell off her chair. As a result, the school board suspended the member for 15 days without pay. <br><br> Based on the evidence, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty, and counsel submissions, the panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct. She was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. Further, she was ordered to complete a course on classroom management and anger management at her own expense. <br><br> ","Member:  Dale Vincent Gerald Maheux Registration No:  537156 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Lambton DSB teacher Dale Vincent Gerald Maheux for sexually abusing a female. <br><br> Maheux, who was licensed to teach in September 2008, was served with the notice of hearing on September 23, 2013, requesting his appearance on October 18, 2013, to set a hearing date. The hearing was held on December 11, 2013, and Maheux was not in attendance, nor was he represented by legal counsel. Satisfied with the evidence in the affidavit that the member had been properly served with the notice of hearing and all disclosure documents, the Discipline Committee panel proceeded to hear the matter in Maheux’s absence. <br><br> It was alleged that Maheux had inappropriate contact with the female, which included rubbing the back of her legs, touching her buttocks and her vagina, and having her touch his penis. In July 2011, Maheux was charged with sexual assault and sexual interference. The Ontario Court of Justice found him guilty of the charges in November 2012 and, in April 2013, Maheux was sentenced to six months in jail. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and College counsel submissions, the panel found Maheux guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his certificate be revoked. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that Maheux “engaged in reprehensible, predatory conduct. Not only did the member sexually abuse the victim, he psychologically abused her…Any penalty short of revocation for such an egregious act would bring the College into disrepute.” <br><br> ","Member:  Wesley James McConnell Registration No:  240064 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Wesley James McConnell for defrauding the Thames Valley DSB of $836,739.56. <br><br> McConnell, who was certified to teach in June 1984, was the Learning Coordinator of Secondary Athletics for the Thames Valley Region Athletic Association (TV RAA), which coordinates sporting events for the Thames Valley DSB, the London District Catholic School Board, the London District Christian SS, Conseil scolaire de district du Centre-Sud-Ouest and Conseil scolaire de district des écoles catholiques du Sud-Ouest. McConnell did not attend the November 27, 2013, hearing, but was represented by a lawyer. <br><br> As the TV RAA Coordinator, McConnell collected payments from the five partners, managed the costs for fields, venue rentals, referees, medics, athletic awards and financial awards for teams taking part in TV RAA championships. He maintained accounting records and prepared annual financial reports for the TV RAA executive and Council. <br><br> Between January 2000 and September 2009, McConnell withdrew $461,962.87 from the TV RAA account by debit card or cash for his personal use, usually in increments of $1,000 to $1,200. The evidence showed he also used TV RAA funds to install a pool and pay for landscaping at his home. <br><br> A financial audit of the association led to a criminal investigation by the London Police Service Fraud Section in October 2009. The investigation revealed that McConnell defrauded the board of $836,739.56. The Board suspended him and he resigned in October 2009. A year later, he was found guilty on a criminal charge of fraud committed between December 1999 and October 2009, and in March 2011 was sentenced to three years in jail. McConnell was also ordered to pay $771,439.56 in restitution to the board. <br><br> Based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and submissions from legal counsel, the panel found McConnell guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “This premeditated, large-scale fraud, over a 10-year period is a serious breach of trust and professional misconduct,” the panel said. “The member betrayed his employer, the profession, the community, student athletes and children in the secondary schools of four boards. The only appropriate penalty to restore public confidence in the teaching profession is revocation of the member’s certificate.” <br><br> ","Member:  Danny Schnabel Registration No:  210962 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of former York Region DSB teacher Danny Schnabel for engaging in an inappropriate personal relationship with a student. <br><br> Schnabel was not present or legally represented at the October 24, 2013, hearing. He was licensed to teach in June 1994. <br><br> In November 2011, Schnabel advised his school principal of a potential threat from the parent of one of his enriched program students after the parent learned that Schnabel had been seeing the girl outside of class. The teacher admitted to inviting the student to his home for dinner in July 2011, and meeting her alone at his home almost weekly from September to November that same year. During that time, he kissed, physically touched and held the student. He also took her by car or public transit to movies, art galleries and her family doctor’s office. Schnabel resigned from the school board in December 2011. <br><br> Based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a plea of guilt to four of six allegations, a joint submission on penalty and the submissions of College counsel, the panel found Schnabel guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. Because the panel felt there was insufficient clarity in the evidence, it found the member not guilty of engaging in sexual abuse of a student and, therefore, dismissed those allegations. <br><br> “Developing a clandestine personal relationship with a student is an abuse of the trust placed in the profession by the community at large,” the panel said in its written decision. “Parents anticipate that their children will be safe in an educational setting. The member took advantage of this trust.” <br><br> ","Member:  Peter David Scorrar Registration No:  224746 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of former Greater Essex County DSB teacher Peter David Scorrar for engaging in a sexual relationship with a student. <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1975, Scorrar was not present or represented legally at the November 25, 2013, hearing. <br><br> At the start of the 1988–89 school year, Scorrar began flirting with one of his students. The conduct continued and escalated to the point at which he kissed her on the lips in sight of other students on the last day of school. That summer, the member visited the student at the restaurant where she was working, walked her to her car after work and kissed her. <br><br> On more than one occasion during the first month of the next school year, the member drove the student to secluded areas where he would rub, fondle and/or kiss her. Between October and December 1989, he engaged in sexual intercourse or other inappropriate sexual conduct with her. <br><br> Also during the 1988–89 academic year, Scorrar invited the student to his home and when confronted by the student’s mother threatened her by saying that she would never see her daughter again. <br><br> The student, now a teacher, provided personal journal entries from the time, a letter from Scorrar and notes from a meeting with the school’s principal to support her testimony. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the panel found Scorrar guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said the member “demonstrated repeated and blatant disregard for the emotional and physical well-being of the student” and that he showed no remorse for his actions. <br><br> ","Member:  Mark Alan H. Speakman Registration No:  219512 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Durham Catholic DSB teacher Mark Speakman and ordered his certificate be suspended with conditions for physically and inappropriately disciplining his students. <br><br> Speakman, who was certified to teach in 1994, attended the public hearing on November 26, 2013, and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that, in April 2008, Speakman grabbed a male student by the shoulders and pushed him. The Durham Children’s Aid Society investigated the matter, confirmed his behaviour was inappropriate and sent a letter to the member. In 2009, while teaching a different grade at a different school, Speakman again used physical force to discipline his students. In one instance, he grabbed a male student by the shoulders in the stairwell. On another occasion, he yelled at a male student, grabbed him by the arm and pushed him against the blackboard. The Durham Children’s Aid Society confirmed Speakman was physically inappropriate and wrote a letter to the school board’s Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources and Administrative Services. <br><br> Based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and submissions from legal counsel, the panel found Speakman guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to suspend his Certificate of Qualification and Registration for one month. Furthermore, Speakman was ordered to appear before the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand and required to successfully complete, at his own expense, pre-approved courses of instruction covering classroom management, appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel affirmed that aggressive contact with students is unacceptable, especially with younger children, and that the penalty sends a message to the profession and to the public that this type of misconduct warrants serious consequences. Protection of the public interest is reflected in the member’s suspension, reprimand and coursework. <br><br> Publication of the member’s name provides the transparency and openness expected by the public, acts as a specific deterrent to the member and provides general deterrence to the profession. <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of a College member who engaged in inappropriate relationships with two students while teaching in British Columbia. <br><br> Licensed to teach in Ontario in June 1991, the member represented himself at the January 9, 2014, hearing. <br><br> While teaching at a BC high school between 1996 and 1998, the member consorted with a student in a two-year relationship that involved flirting, personal conversations, kissing, hugging, gift giving, and sexual fondling over and under clothing. The member told the student that, even though their relationship was special, he could lose his job if other people learned about it. <br><br> Between 1995 and 1997, the member sat a second student on a desk, spread her knees with his hands and told her, “I would like to rip your shirt off right now.” On another occasion when the student was at his home he invited her to try out his new shower. <br><br> In September 2002, he resigned from teaching at the board. In December 2004, the BC College of Teachers found him guilty of professional misconduct and cancelled his teaching certificate there. <br><br> Based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions of the member and College counsel, the panel found him guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member has betrayed the trust placed in him by the public, one that is implicit in his status as a teacher,” the panel wrote in its decision. “Young people were in his care, and he abused these young people by placing them in sexualized situations. Further, his efforts at hiding these relationships demonstrate significant premeditation.”","Member:  James Allan Biss Registration No:  463213 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of a high school teacher after he was convicted of the sexual exploitation of a female student. <br><br> James Allan Biss, who was certified to teach in July 2003, did not attend the December 17, 2013, hearing and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Biss was employed by the Peel DSB in the 2009–10 and 2010–11 academic years. In the summer of 2010, he was also employed by the Toronto Catholic DSB. <br><br> Biss and a student began to correspond electronically in February 2010 and developed an inappropriate relationship. They exchanged personal emails and texts, including sexual messages, and he bought her a dress and shoes. He allowed the student to stay in his hotel room and had a sexual relationship with her. <br><br> Biss was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in October 2010, the panel heard. <br><br> Peel Regional Police arrested Biss in February 2011 and charged him with sexual exploitation and sexual assault. He pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation at his trial in June 2012. The Crown withdrew the sexual assault charge. In September 2012, Biss was sentenced to 14 months in prison and three years of probation. <br><br> College counsel advised the committee that an agreement of the facts had been reached and introduced a guilty plea to professional misconduct. Biss denied that he engaged in the sexual abuse of a student. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, and submissions made by College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Biss guilty of professional misconduct. The panel directed the Registrar to revoke Biss’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “Conduct of a sexual nature involving a student represents the most heinous breach of trust from a person in a position of trust and authority over a student,” the panel’s written decision said. “The member demonstrated complete lack of care and safety for the student in imposing a relationship of a sexual nature that could leave psychological and emotional scars for life on the student.” <br><br> ","Member:  Richard S. Buckley, OCT Registration No:  438110 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Bluewater DSB teacher Richard Buckley in connection with a criminal conviction for criminal harassment. <br><br> Richard Buckley, who was certified to teach in June 2000, attended the May 2, 2014, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> After pleading guilty to a criminal charge in March 2009, Buckley received a conditional discharge and 12-month probation. <br><br> In 2007, Buckley became infatuated with a colleague and engaged in repeated unwanted contact with her over 18 months, including calling her home on several occasions and attempting to approach her. Finally, during a staff party, Buckley had a verbal altercation with the colleague during which he threw at her the letter she had written to him advising him to stay away from her. This behaviour resulted in the criminal harassment charge and guilty plea. <br><br> Based on an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Buckley guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to face the panel after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Buckley was ordered to complete a course of instruction pre-approved by the Registrar on appropriate boundaries with respect to colleagues, at his own expense. <br><br> “The member’s actions comprised a serious breach of trust and showed a blatant lack of professional judgment, causing another member of the College to fear for her safety,’’ the panel said in its written decision. “The Committee denounces the Member’s behaviour and is confident that the penalty, with its many elements, is in the public interest.” <br><br> ","Member:  Barbara Ann Cameron Registration No:  281435 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended and reprimanded Upper Canada DSB teacher Barbara Ann Cameron for criminal convictions for fraud, theft and forgery. <br><br> Certified to teach in October 1997, Cameron attended the March 7, 2014, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> As the treasurer of the Upper Canada local of the Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario (ETFO), Cameron wrote 93 cheques to herself between July 2005 and October 2007 totalling $55,943.94, and paid for purchases on her personal credit card and gas card from federation funds. A police investigation revealed that Cameron forged signatures nine times and made efforts to undermine any potential investigation by removing financial documents. <br><br> She turned herself into police in July 2010 and was charged with theft over $5,000 and knowingly using a forged cheque from the EFTO Upper Canada account. In November 2011, she pleaded guilty to charges of theft over $5,000 and uttering a forged document. In April 2012, she received a conditional sentence of two years less a day, including 18 months’ house arrest followed by three years of probation. As part of the criminal proceedings, Cameron agreed she had fraudulently taken $39,835.59 and agreed to pay an additional $14,000 back to ETFO. As agreed, she made restitution. <br><br> Aware of the criminal proceedings and outcome, the Upper Canada DSB returned Cameron to the classroom in September 2012 before her house arrest was completed. She has been teaching successfully with the board since. <br><br> The panel found Cameron guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty and the submissions of legal counsel. The panel directed the Registrar to suspend Cameron’s teaching certificate from March 8, 2014, to August 17, 2015. Further, she was ordered to face a reprimand from the panel immediately following the hearing. <br><br> “The member betrayed the ethical standards of the profession to an extreme level,” the panel said in its written decision. “The member consciously attempted to deflect the blame by trying to demonstrate that others were partly to blame for her behaviour. [She] knew that what she was doing was wrong, fundamentally illegal and criminal. This element of knowing the nature of her misconduct and not stopping herself make a reprimand even more appropriate.” <br><br> ","Member:  Ronald James Curridor Registration No:  261178 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered London District Catholic SB principal Ronald James Curridor to receive a reprimand and a suspension for professional misconduct. <br><br> Curridor, who was licensed to teach in June 1991, attended the May 8, 2014, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> From 2007 to 2010, Curridor breached the rules regarding the administration of the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) tests. He removed test materials from the package and provided them to teachers prior to the day of the assessment; modified the multiple choice answer sheet of at least one Grade 6 student; permitted or directed students who did not meet the requirements for accommodations to have scribes assist them with the test; and allowed students who did not have an Individual Education Plan or other permitted circumstances to leave the classroom to assist them with the test. He also told teachers that he had discretion in administering the test even though no such discretion was permitted. <br><br> As a result of Curridor’s actions and following the school board’s investigation, the EQAO withdrew its reporting of the school’s results for the 2007 to 2010 school years. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Curridor guilty of professional misconduct, ordered that his certificate be suspended for not less than three months and that he appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand. In addition, Curridor was ordered to complete a course of instruction pre-approved by the Registrar on professional ethics at his own expense. <br><br> “As a school leader, the member was given the responsibility for the ethical administration of the EQAO test in his school. He failed to do this and consciously undermined their integrity,’’ the panel said in its written decision. “The Committee considers the member’s behaviour to be serious and warrants significant sanctions.” <br><br> ","Member:  Jeremy Russell Davidson Registration No:  475976 Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered Kawartha Pine Ridge DSB teacher Jeremy Russell Davidson to receive a reprimand for professional misconduct. <br><br> Davidson, who was licensed to teach in September 2004, represented himself at the May 22, 2014, hearing. <br><br> During the 2010–11 school year, Davidson left school early without notifying administration, made inappropriate and offensive comments of a sexual nature to his colleagues and publicly disrespected the administration. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Davidson guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that he appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In determining whether the joint submission represented a sufficient penalty, the Committee took into account the member’s undertaking. The member agreed to provide the Registrar with a report from his physician regarding his ability to return to teaching and has undertaken to successfully complete a course or courses of instruction pre-approved by the Registrar in lesson planning, student assessment, classroom management and appropriate boundaries, at his own expense. <br><br> “Student safety is of paramount importance in the teaching profession. The Committee takes the member’s neglect of this responsibility very seriously. Leaving school early or failing to attend without notification to administration is unacceptable. Furthermore, a teacher is expected to be a role model for students by treating colleagues with dignity and respect,’’ the panel said in its written decision. <br><br> ","Member:  Timothy Matthew Scott Dingwall, OCT Registration No:  275665 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Toronto DSB teacher Timothy Matthew Scott Dingwall for engaging in an unprofessional relationship with a student. <br><br> Dingwall, who was certified to teach in March 1997, attended the March 7, 2014, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> During the 2009–10 school year, Dingwall went for coffee, meals and a movie with a female student. He also talked to her in person and on the phone about personal matters and gave her the gift of a book. There were no discussions or conduct of a sexual nature, but Dingwall hugged the student regularly as a form of greeting and farewell. He told her that their relationship was wrong and that they should not see each other outside of school. In August 2011, the school board suspended Dingwall for 20 days. Since then, he has been teaching in another school for four years without further issue. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a partial joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and the submissions of counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Dingwall guilty of professional misconduct. He was directed to face the panel immediately after the hearing to face a reprimand. Further, he was ordered to take a pre-approved course regarding boundary violations at his own expense and report to the Registrar upon its completion. <br><br> In determining penalty, the panel noted that Dingwall had already been suspended by the board, understood that he breached the profession’s ethical standards, instigated his rehabilitative coursework and accepted a transfer to another school where he successfully re-established his teaching career. <br><br> ","Member:  Rick William Doran Registration No:  484774 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended, reprimanded and imposed conditions on a Windsor-Essex Catholic DSB teacher for assaulting students in his care resulting in a criminal conviction. <br><br> Rick William Doran, who was certified to teach in November 2004, attended the May 7, 2014, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that Doran, who taught at two of the board’s schools, used his wet thumb to clean around the mouth of a student, and patted or slapped the buttocks of three other students several times in incidents occurring between 2005 and 2009. <br><br> The school board fired Doran in May 2009 and, in October 2009, the College’s Registrar suspended his teaching certificate until such time as the Discipline Committee could hear the complaint. In November 2010, Doran pleaded guilty in criminal court to assaulting the students for which he received a suspended sentence and two years’ probation. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and the submissions of legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Doran guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand following the hearing. Doran’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration was suspended retroactively from February 4 to May 6, 2014. <br><br> Prior to starting any position that requires a teaching certificate, Doran must successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course regarding boundary issues and violations and give written proof from the provider to the Registrar of its successful completion. <br><br> “The reprimand and coursework serve an educational function as they provide the member with an assessment of his conduct and reinforce the necessity to maintain appropriate professional boundaries,” the panel said in its written decision. “Coursework focusing on appropriate boundaries between teachers and students ensures the rehabilitation of the member and the protection of the public.” <br><br> ","Member:  Joseph René Gilles Gosselin Registration No:  299215 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Joseph René Gilles Gosselin, an assistant principal and teacher with the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial in Nova Scotia, for unacceptable conduct with students and colleagues. <br><br> Gosselin was certified to teach in Ontario in November 1988 and in Nova Scotia where he was employed by the Nova Scotia Department of Education. He did not attend the February 4, 2014, hearing and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> While teaching in Nova Scotia between 2007 and 2009, Gosselin talked with students about his relationship with his wife and other women, and his sister’s abortion. He made sexual comments to female colleagues and rubbed up against one in the school hallway. He also went to dinner with a female student and conducted experiments in the classroom, which included the use of chemicals such as mercury. Following due process, Nova Scotia’s Minister of Education cancelled Gosselin’s teaching certificate in February 2011. <br><br> Based on the exhibits filed, evidence — including the finding of professional misconduct by the NS Department of Education — and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Gosselin guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The revocation of the Certificate of Qualification and Registration is warranted by the decision of the Nova Scotia Department of Education,” the panel’s written decision said. “The (panel) is not convinced that the member fully comprehends the importance of respecting the boundaries between students and teachers, which should not be crossed. The revocation is necessary for the purposes of ensuring students’ safety and of serving and protecting the public interest.” <br><br> ","Member:  Timothy Richard Jarzylo Registration No:  176741 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded former Near North DSB teacher Timothy Jarzylo for repeated use of inappropriate physical contact to discipline students. <br><br> Jarzylo, who was certified to teach in June 1983, did not attend the March 6, 2014, hearing, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that Jarzylo sent two male students out of his class for talking in the fall of 2011. While they were in the hall, Jarzylo approached one of the students, placed his hands on the student’s chest and pushed him away from the lockers. He then told him to stop talking and go to the office. <br><br> In April 2011, Jarzylo was previously admonished by an Investigation Committee panel for a complaint involving two incidents of inappropriate physical intervention with students that occurred on December 1, 2008, and April 3, 2009. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the onus and standard of proof, a plea of no contest, a statement of uncontested facts, and the submissions of legal counsel, the panel found Jarzylo guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> Jarzylo retired from teaching in April 2012. “The member has demonstrated a pattern of behaviour that speaks to a recidivist nature of using inappropriate physical contact in disciplining students,” the panel said in its written decision. “This behaviour was demonstrated during a time when the member was under review by the Investigation Committee for the same inappropriate approach to discipline.” <br><br> Jarzylo was ordered to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. He was also directed to complete a course, at his own expense, about appropriate discipline interventions before working at any school. Jarzylo must provide the Registrar with a written certificate from the course provider within 30 days of successfully completing the course and before returning to work as a teacher. Within 30 days of returning to work, Jarzylo must provide the Registrar with proof of the date he started and the name of his employer. <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel found a Conseil scolaire de district catholique de l’Est ontarien teacher guilty of professional misconduct for receiving three unsatisfactory performance appraisals. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in August 1990, attended the February 27, 2014, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that the member was appraised three times in 2005, 2006 and 2010. On each appraisal, his performance was unsatisfactory in course planning, knowledge of the program and his assessment of student achievement. <br><br> The member was on medical leave from November 2002 until April 2005. He returned to teach full time in September 2005. During his leave, the Ministry of Education introduced a new curriculum and a new policy on assessing student achievement. <br><br> The member’s lawyer maintained that the teacher tried to improve his performance and succeeded. She said the member has retired and has no intention of returning to teaching. <br><br> After considering the exhibits, a statement of uncontested facts, plea of no contest and submissions of counsel, the committee found the teacher guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The panel ordered the Registrar to impose conditions on the member’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration. Before accepting a position that requires a teaching certificate, the member must complete a course, at his own expense, pre-approved by the Registrar that focuses on lesson planning, classroom management, student assessment and record keeping. The course must be equivalent in length to an Additional Qualification course. The member must provide written proof to the Registrar within 30 days that he successfully completed the course. <br><br> The member must also advise the Registrar he is resuming teaching at least 10 days before starting to work, and he must take reasonable steps to ensure his employer conducts two performance appraisals of him within 24 months. <br><br> “The order constitutes a rehabilitative measure for the member if he wishes to return to teaching and allows him to carry out his professional responsibilities,” the discipline panel said in its written decision. <br><br> ","Member:  Dale Vincent Gerald Maheux Registration No:  537156 Decision:  Publication <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered the publication of additional findings concerning Lambton Kent DSB teacher Dale Vincent Gerald Maheux whose certificate was already revoked in connection with a criminal conviction for sexual assault and sexual exploitation. <br><br> Maheux, who was licensed to teach in September 2008, did not attend the hearing held on May 8, 2014, nor was he represented by a lawyer. <br><br> In April 2013, Maheux was found guilty of sexually exploiting a 15-year-old female between January 2008 and November 2012. He pleaded guilty in criminal court and was sentenced to three years in jail. <br><br> Having been convicted of sexual assault and sexual exploitation of a young person, Maheux, while waiting for the imposition of a sentence in that matter, repeated the sexual interference with another young person. <br><br> Although a Discipline Committee panel had revoked Maheux’s certificate on December 11, 2013, the second panel had an obligation and right to make public Maheux’s ongoing misconduct. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Maheux guilty of professional misconduct. Had Maheux’s certificate not already been revoked, revocation would have been the result. <br><br> “The conduct of the member towards a young person sinks to the level of abhorrence and was fundamentally reprehensible, in fact it was vile,” the panel said in its written decision. “Publication of the findings with the member’s name serves to advise the profession and the public that sexual misconduct will result in the severest penalty available and certain public denunciation.” <br><br> ","Member:  Uwe Dieter Neumann, OCT Registration No:  247666 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Bluewater DSB teacher Uwe Dieter Neumann for failing to adequately supervise students and maintain appropriate safety standards in his shop classroom. <br><br> Neumann, who was certified to teach in June 1994, attended the February 21, 2014, hearing with legal counsel. <br><br> Despite multiple concerted efforts to address the severe health and safety issues in his classroom, Neumann’s misconduct continued from 2004 to 2007. <br><br> In 2004, he failed to prevent students from using an electric grinder outside the shop while the ground was wet. Following an anonymous complaint about conditions in the classroom, an inspector for the Ministry of Labour, Occupational Health and Safety visited the school to investigate. <br><br> In April and May of 2005, the school board’s health and safety officer investigated after a student suffered welder’s flash to his eyes (inflammation of the cornea) in Neumann’s class. The safety officer’s report concluded that Neumann did not prevent three students with insufficient equipment from welding in an area that did not adequately protect them. <br><br> In December 2006, the school’s vice-principal requested a meeting with Neumann to ensure that he was clear about his responsibility to address health and safety issues. However, in April 2007, another student suffered welder’s flash to the eye while in Neumann’s manufacturing technology class. That same month, Neumann did not properly maintain a clear passage to fire exits or remove obstructions in his class. <br><br> In June 2007, he allowed students to dismantle and move three pieces of heavy equipment from the classroom, including a band saw, metal shaper and lathe. He also had the lathe removed to a private facility without authorization from the school administration. <br><br> The board suspended Neumann for seven days without pay in June 2007. He has continued teaching since then, but not in a manufacturing technology classroom. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest and submissions of legal counsel, the panel found Neumann guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> “The member engaged in repeated inappropriate misconduct over several years,” the panel said in its written decision. “He failed to adequately supervise and maintain appropriate safety standards in the shop classroom. This blatant disregard by the member for the health and safety of his students resulted in students being seriously injured over this four-year period.” <br><br> Neumann was ordered to appear before the Discipline Committee to receive a reprimand. He must successfully complete a course pre-approved by the Registrar that focuses on manufacturing-based technology, at his own expense, before teaching in that area. He must also successfully complete a course on classroom management with an emphasis on supervision and classroom safety. <br><br> ","Member:  Trace Russell Teeple Registration No:  250173 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Halton DSB teacher Trace Russell Teeple for possessing child pornography. <br><br> Teeple, who was licensed to teach in January 1987, did not attend the hearing held on May 2, 2014, and was not represented by a lawyer. <br><br> In September 2012, Teeple was found guilty of the charge that he possessed child pornography during the 2009 calendar year. He pleaded guilty in the criminal proceedings and, in April 2013, he was sentenced to 45 days in jail and 24 months’ probation. He was also prohibited for 10 years from using a computer to communicate with anyone under 16. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Teeple guilty of professional misconduct and ordered the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> “The member has exhibited such an insidious breach of trust that he has forfeited the right to be a member of the teaching profession,’’ the panel said in its written decision. “The College will not tolerate such behaviour and will ensure that this type of misconduct is dealt with severely. <br><br> ","Member:  Stephanie Marie Vaillancourt, OCT Registration No:  265808 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel found Algoma DSB teacher Stephanie Marie Vaillancourt guilty of professional misconduct for a breach of supervision during a class trip and for posting student photos from the trip on her personal Facebook page without permission. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 1993, did not attend the April 14, 2014, hearing but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, during a class trip in June 2010, Vaillancourt slept in the cabin where she was supervising five female students. Each of the cabins had an adult chaperone. Vaillancourt allowed students to leave the cabin unsupervised for a short period in the early morning hours to go to a trampoline, which was in an open field. After the trip, Vaillancourt posted pictures of her students from the trip on her personal Facebook page without parental permission. <br><br> The school board suspended her for five days without pay. <br><br> After considering the evidence, the agreed statement of facts, joint submission on penalty, the member’s guilty plea, the onus and standard of proof, and the submissions of counsel, the panel found Vaillancourt guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> Vaillancourt was ordered to appear before the Discipline Committee to receive a reprimand. The Registrar was directed to impose conditions on the member’s Certificate of Qualification and Registration. She must complete a course pre-approved by the Registrar regarding appropriate boundaries at her own expense. The member must provide written proof from the course provider to the College that she successfully completed the course within 30 days of finishing. <br><br> “Breaches in student supervision and student privacy will not be tolerated in the profession. The protection and safety of students, on or off school property, must be upheld at all times,” the Discipline Committee panel said in its written decision. ","Member:  Jeffrey Tavis Bussineau, OCT Registration No:  467352 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of Algoma District School Board’s teacher Jeffrey Bussineau for failing to maintain appropriate boundaries with a female student. <br><br> Bussineau, who was certified to teach in June 2003, was represented by a lawyer and attended the hearings that were held on July 8 and 9, November 14, December 18, 2013, January 14 and 15, and August 7, 2014. <br><br> During the 2009–10 academic year, Bussineau had an inappropriate personal relationship with the student, which included engaging in electronic communication with her via Facebook and calling her “hon” and/or “cutie pie.” <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and legal submissions. <br><br> The panel ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for one month and that he appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Bussineau was directed to complete a course of instruction in boundary violations at his own expense. <br><br> The panel was of the opinion that the member did not seem to be aware of the Professional Advisory — Use of Electronic Communication and Social Media issued by the College. This advisory addresses the numerous challenges and the ramifications associated with the use of electronic communication and social media. <br><br> The member acknowledged that engaging in electronic communication with the student constituted an inappropriate personal relationship. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “[He] needs to take a specifically created boundaries course which addresses his professional shortcomings and will assist him in modifying his behaviour, should he return to the classroom … The public can be assured that the College takes very seriously the professional misconduct demonstrated in this matter.” <br><br> ","Member:  Andrew Stuart Campbell, OCT Registration No:  185224 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Grand Erie District School Board teacher Andrew Stuart Campbell and ordered his certificate be suspended with conditions for engaging in inappropriate conduct over a number of years. <br><br> Campbell, who was certified to teach in 1993, did not attend the public hearing on June 30, 2014, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that in February 2008, Campbell struck a female student on the back with a volleyball and hit her on her shin with his knuckles. The Children’s Aid Society investigated the matter and confirmed his behaviour was inappropriate. During the same academic year, while teaching at a different school, Campbell grabbed the arm of a male student and applied physical pressure to move him out of a room. <br><br> The panel also heard that during the 2005–06 and the 2007–08 academic years, Campbell used sexualized and abusive language toward students and inappropriate teaching materials for school-aged children. His behaviour was unchanged despite multiple warnings, suspensions, counselling and transfer to another school. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and the submissions made by legal counsel, the panel found Campbell guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to suspend his Certificate of Qualification and Registration for two months. Furthermore, Campbell was ordered to appear before the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand, and required to successfully complete, at his own expense, a preapproved course of instruction covering anger management and sensitivity training within three months. <br><br> The panel agreed that the member needed to understand the serious nature of his misconduct, and the need for appropriate professional judgment in his practice and respectful treatment of children. Protection of the public interest is reflected in the member’s suspension, reprimand and coursework. <br><br> Publication of the member’s name assures the public that the College will not tolerate such behaviour and will ensure that this type of repeated misconduct will garner such a penalty. <br><br> ","Member:  Martin Careen Registration No:  291611 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Martin Careen, a former member of the College and a former teacher in British Columbia, related to a criminal conviction for sexual exploitation. <br><br> Certified to teach in February 1994, Careen did not attend the May 30, 2014, hearing nor was his lawyer present. <br><br> On July 13, 2011, Careen was found guilty of sexual exploitation following a trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice Terence Schultes, in British Columbia. Careen had sent sexually explicit text messages to a student. <br><br> In his judgment, the judge noted, with respect to the text messages, “I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Careen at the time of these communications intended that (the student) would receive his words as an invitation, incitement or counselling to engage in sexual activity with him.” <br><br> On May 16, 2012, Careen was sentenced to a 60-day jail sentence to be served intermittently at three-week intervals. <br><br> Careen pleaded guilty to the allegations of professional misconduct made against him by the College. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts and a joint submission on penalty as well as College counsel submissions, the panel found Careen guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his certificate. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel affirmed that “such behaviour represents an egregious breach of trust between a teacher and a student under his care. The member has therefore forfeited the privilege of holding a teaching certificate and being a member of the profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Richard William Cole Registration No:  423638 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Rainbow District School Board teacher Richard William Cole related to a criminal conviction for copying sexually explicit photos from students’ computers and downloading pornography on his school-assigned computer during work hours. <br><br> Licensed to teach in February 2000, Cole did not attend the June 16, 2014, hearing but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> On or about June 23, 2006, a school technician, while performing maintenance activities, found sexually explicit images on Cole’s computer. In addition to his teaching duties, Cole had a supervisory role of the operations of the school’s computer network. <br><br> A board technician later confirmed that Cole’s computer contained 379 sexually explicit pictures that he had copied from students’ computers. The technician also confirmed that Cole was surfing and downloading pornographic material on his work laptop. <br><br> In April 2013, the member voluntarily agreed to have his teaching certifi cate rescinded and pleaded guilty in the Ontario Court of Justice to interfering with the lawful use of data. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and submissions of College counsel and counsel for the member, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct, and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> The panel found that “The member abused his position of authority by not reporting to administration that he found pornographic images in a student’s file” and “copied these images onto his school computer. He “also copied pornographic images, movies and explicit materials from other students’ pictures fi les.” Further, “the member’s conduct was unacceptable, disgraceful and illustrated an abuse of power and trust.” <br><br> ","Member:  Karl Dreger, OCT Registration No:  195939 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed Karl Dreger, a principal of the Sudbury Catholic District School Board, to receive a reprimand in connection with a criminal conviction for altering a medical prescription. <br><br> Dreger, who was certified to teach in June 1995, attended the June 30, 2014, hearing, and was represented by a lawyer. <br><br> In October 2010, Dreger altered a medical prescription from 30 to 80 tablets of Percocet, leading the pharmacist to determine he had forged it. In February 2011, he was criminally charged and pleaded guilty to forgery in April of the same year. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, and a guilty plea. <br><br> He was directed to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand.

The Discipline Committee further found the member engaged in sexual abuse of a student and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> The panel found that his “behaviour has brought the profession into disrepute and was in conflict with the duty of a teacher to protect students.” <br><br> ","Member:  Kerry Stephen Powers Registration No:  479346 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Peel District School Board teacher Kerry Stephen Powers and ordered his certificate be suspended with conditions for ignoring his board’s policy about excursions and the ratio of supervision required. <br><br> Powers, who was certified to teach in June 2004, was represented by legal counsel and attended the public hearings on June 9 and 10, 2014, and November 25, 26 and 28, 2014. <br><br> The panel heard that, in and around February 5 to February 7, 2009, during a school trip for a conference, Powers was the only one responsible for a group of about 34 students who stayed at a hotel. On the first evening, he allowed students free access to his hotel room to prepare their presentations and to iron their clothing. <br><br> On the same evening, Powers left the hotel after 11 p.m. and, in doing so, left the students unsupervised by any teacher from the school. Students requiring assistance were unable to locate him. Powers returned to the hotel several hours later. His board conducted an investigation and suspended him for five days without pay, and banned him from attending overnight excursions for the 2009/2010 school year. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions made by legal counsel, the panel found Powers guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to suspend his Certificate of Qualification and Registration for five days. His certificate was suspended from July 6 to 10, 2009. <br><br> Furthermore, Powers was ordered to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand, and required to successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course of instruction covering effective supervision and boundaries. <br><br> ","Member:  Theresa Liana Riccardi, OCT Registration No:  256783 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed Theresa Liana Riccardi, a York Catholic District School Board teacher, to receive a reprimand for acting inappropriately and insufficiently without proper regard for student safety. <br><br> Riccardi, who was certified to teach in June 1987, attended the hearings with her legal counsel on October 10, 11 and 30, 2013, and October 20, 2014. <br><br> During the 2009–10 academic year, the member:  <br><br> The panel heard evidence that she was unable to manage and control students and to appropriately report numerous incidents to the school administration. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and legal submissions. She was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. As well, Riccardi was ordered to complete a pre-approved course, at her own expense, regarding classroom management and effective student discipline. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that “a course on classroom management and effective student discipline was necessary because the member continued to display a lack of insight into her misconduct years after the underlying incidents had occurred.” <br><br> ","Member:  Christopher Nicholas Sager Registration No:  520995 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Christopher Nicholas Sager, a former Durham District School Board teacher, in connection with a criminal conviction for criminal harassment involving a female student. <br><br> Licensed to teach in May 2007, Sager attended the November 10, 2014, hearing, and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> During the 2009–10 school year, Sager developed a personal relationship that evolved into a sexual relationship with a student. <br><br> In May 2010, Sager was charged by Durham Regional Police with three counts of sexual exploitation. That same month, the school board terminated his employment. <br><br> In November 2010, he pled guilty to criminal harassment. He received a suspended sentence and was placed on probation for three years. His probation conditions included the following:  <br><br> In March 2014, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services confirmed that the probation, which started on November 26, 2010, expired on November 25, 2013, and that Sager is no longer subject to probation conditions. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty, and submissions made by legal counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Sager guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> The panel found that his “conduct was unacceptable, disgraceful, dishonourable, and illustrated an abuse of power.” <br><br> ","Member:  Alfred Douglas Stelpstra Registration No:  251850 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Alfred Douglas Stelpstra due to a criminal charge for possession of child pornography. <br><br> Licensed to teach in June 1992, Stelpstra did not attend the public hearing on November 13, 2014, nor was he represented by legal counsel. Since about 2000, and except for one week in approximately 2008 when he did supply teaching, Stelpstra has not been involved in the teaching profession. <br><br> On March 9, 2010, the Kingston Police executed a search warrant at Stelpstra’s home and found many pictures and videos of child pornography on his computer. He was subsequently charged with one count of possession of child pornography. On or about June 4, 2012, in the Ontario Court of Justice, he was granted a stay of proceedings as a result of a violation of his section 11(b) rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. <br><br> On July 23, 2010, he signed an Agreement and Undertaking not to teach or seek employment for which a Certificate of Qualification and Registration is required until the College disposes of this complaint. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a guilty plea, a joint submission on penalty, and submissions of College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Stelpstra guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> The panel found that Stelpstra “has forfeited the privilege of holding a certificate and should not be permitted to teach in Ontario.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Counselling, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel counselled a Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board teacher for crossing professional boundaries. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in October 1991, attended the November 13, 2014, hearing, and was represented by a lawyer. <br><br> During the 2007–08 academic year, the member engaged in a relationship and activities with students that included attending a movie, accompanying students on a trip, allowing students to drive her motor vehicle, and going to a coffee shop and local restaurant outside of school hours. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty, and the submissions of legal counsel. <br><br> The member was directed to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to be counselled. As well, the member was ordered to successfully complete a pre-approved course, at her own expense, regarding boundary violations. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that “counselling is appropriate in this matter and acts as a specific deterrent to the member.” <br><br> ","Member:  Aidan Elizabeth Welland, OCT Registration No:  431351 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Toronto District School Board teacher Aidan Elizabeth Welland for making false accusations toward a student, a colleague and another professional. <br><br> Welland, who was certified to teach in June 2000, attended the public hearing on October 14, 2014, and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that, in December 2011, Welland, using a pseudonym, sent emails to the principal of a school attended by a student who she falsely alleged had bullied her son — even though her son and the student did not attend the same school. She also falsely alleged that the student’s teacher had ignored the bullying and failed to protect her son. <br><br> Furthermore, she posted false comments about the student and his parent on a public website, using a pseudonym. Welland, using a different pseudonym, made false allegations about another professional by emailing his principal and alleging that he planned to take several sick days off to take his family on vacation. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and submissions of Counsel, the panel found Welland guilty of professional misconduct and ordered her to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> The panel also required her to successfully complete, at her own expense, pre-approved courses of instruction covering ethics in the workplace and appropriate personal and professional boundaries in the workplace within six months. <br><br> The panel agreed that publication of this summary with her name published is necessary because Welland, on multiple occasions, used pseudonyms to protect her own identity, and made false accusations toward a student, a colleague and another professional. The panel said that “the member’s disregard for others’ privacy and reputation forfeits her request that her name not be published.”","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed a Limestone District School Board teacher to receive a reprimand regarding a verbal incident with a male student. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 2004, attended the hearing on November 24, 2014, with his legal counsel. <br><br> On March 7, 2012, the member was informed by the vice-principal that a colleague overheard a male student bullying another student. The bullied student expressed his anxiety and worries to the member about seeing the bully in class. <br><br> Later that day, the member saw the student who engaged in bullying in the hallway and used language that could be perceived as a threat toward the student. The student complained to the police and the member was charged with uttering a threat to cause bodily harm. The charge was withdrawn in October 2012 at the Crown’s request with the agreement that the member apologize in writing to the student. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, a statement of uncontested facts, a joint submission on penalty, a plea of no contest, and legal submissions. The member was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand immediately following the hearing. As well, the member was ordered to complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course on effective communication strategies and management of difficult situations. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel agreed that the misconduct was on the lower end of the spectrum and “determined that publication, without name, was appropriate in the circumstances of this case.” <br><br> ","Member:  Brounislaw John Bulat Registration No:  220172 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of College member Brounislaw John Bulat in connection with five criminal convictions including attempted murder. <br><br> Licensed to teach in June 1969, Bulat did not attend the November 19, 2014, hearing nor was he represented by legal counsel. He is currently incarcerated and is serving a six-year sentence for his crimes. <br><br> The panel heard that Bulat harassed a former girlfriend and breached a restraining order to keep away from her. While driving his vehicle in the Town of Tecumseh in the Southwest Region, he rammed twice into a vehicle driven by the current boyfriend of his former girlfriend. When the boyfriend exited the vehicle, Bulat proceeded to run him over, causing bodily harm, and fled the scene. In May 2013, he was found guilty of a number of charges including attempted murder. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and submissions made by College counsel, the Discipline Committee panel found Bulat guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> ","Member:  John Bryant, OCT Registration No:  399541 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered Toronto District School Board teacher John Bryant to receive a reprimand for using inappropriate language and failing to supervise students. <br><br> Bryant, who was certified to teach in June 1990, did not attend the public hearing on November 20, 2014, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that, during the 2012–13 school year, Bryant used inappropriate language such as referring to a female student as a “bitch” and calling a male student a “cocky son of a bitch.” During a viewing of a movie in class, Bryant made a number of inappropriate comments including “You are fucking ugly,” “You are so fucking gay” and “You are a dumb ass.” Although the comments were directed at the movie and not at the students, they made some of the students feel uncomfortable. <br><br> Bryant also took students off school property in his personal vehicle without parental or administrative consent. <br><br> The board issued three letters of reprimand, suspending Bryant’s employment as a result of these incidents. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and the submissions made by legal counsel, the panel found Bryant guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand, and was required to successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course of instruction covering professional ethics and professional boundaries. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “The member’s behaviour indicated a lack of professionalism with his use of profanity both in and outside the classroom. Further, the course on professional ethics and boundaries will remind the member that conduct such as leaving school property with students and without permission is unacceptable.” <br><br> ","Member:  Michael Wade Canning, OCT Registration No:  196582 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Durham Catholic District School Board transportation technology teacher Michael Wade Canning for failing to register a transfer of ownership of a vehicle donated to the Board, and transferring ownership into the name of a family member instead. <br><br> Canning, who was certified to teach in June 1995, attended the public hearing on February 19, 2015, with his legal counsel. <br><br> Canning was responsible for teaching students about automobiles, which he did by having students work on cars in the auto shop. People would donate their cars to the school and receive a receipt from the school with the estimated value of the car. <br><br> The panel heard that in or around March 2011, a donor gave a 1998 Toyota Camry to the school for which Canning provided a letter confirming receipt of the vehicle. Despite confirming receipt, Canning did not register a transfer of ownership of the vehicle to the board with the Ministry of Transportation. <br><br> About a year later, the member transferred the ownership into the name of his sister-in-law. He made two requests to the donor asking permission to do so but failed to disclose that the transfer had already taken place. In response to his requests, the donor made it clear that she would not consent to the transfer of ownership. Canning also took the vehicle home for two days. <br><br> In May 2012, the donor contacted the school principal and Canning was assigned to home duties. Three months later, he pled guilty under the Highway Traffic Act for failing to apply for a permit within six days of being an owner of a vehicle. <br><br> The panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand, and required that he successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course of ethics within three months of the order. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “The member lied to the donor about the transfer of ownership and he removed the vehicle from school property without the consent of the school or the donor ... [his] conduct was deceptive, unethical and lacked the professional integrity expected of all teachers.” <br><br> ","Member:  Elisabetta Teresa De Santis, OCT Registration No:  429783 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed Elisabetta Teresa De Santis, a College member employed by the Toronto District School Board, to receive a reprimand for using inappropriate language. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in August 1999, partly attended the December 9, 2014, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> On or around February 2, 2012, De Santis used inappropriate language with a male student who required assistive technology in the classroom. The student and some classmates found the language derogatory, and five students reported the incident to the principal. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty, and legal submissions. <br><br> The member was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand within 60 days of the date of the hearing. As well, the member was ordered to complete a pre-approved course, at her own expense, on classroom management and sensitivity to students. <br><br> ","Member:  Laird Arthur Evans Registration No:  152133 Decision:  Suspension <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel supended the certificate of Ottawa-Carleton District School Board’s teacher Laird Arthur Evans for storing real and replica weapons and ammunition in a school, and making them available to students. <br><br> Evans, who was certified to teach in June 1975, was not initially represented by a lawyer, and did not attend the hearing on October 22, 2014. He did not attend his hearing on November 3, 2014, but was represented by legal counsel. The panel ordered that the portion of the hearing dealing with Evans’s detailed medical evidence be closed. <br><br> While a teacher, Evans stored a collection of firearms including functional, deactivated and replica weapons, a rifle and a high capacity Uzi magazine at the school. He also permitted students to access the weapons at the school. <br><br> He was found guilty of possession of a firearm without a licence, contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada. He received a conditional discharge and was placed on probation for a period of 12 months. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Evans guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and legal submissions. <br><br> The panel ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for 12 months from the date of the panel’s decision. <br><br> The panel noted Evans’s current state of health but also noted that he was not in poor health at the time of the events that led to these proceedings. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “[He] may not have had ill-intentions when he committed the acts that gave rise to these proceedings; however, the member’s conduct was egregious and it endangered his students and his colleagues.” <br><br> ","Member:  Laurene Elizabeth Green, OCT Registration No:  167444 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed Laurene Elizabeth Green, a Toronto District School Board teacher, to receive a reprimand for misconduct. As an assistant curriculum leader for a school’s technology department, Green held a position of responsibility with the board. <br><br> Green, who was certified to teach in June 1992, attended the February 20, 2015, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The misconduct — which happened between 2009 and 2012 — included the removal of two workbenches from the school without authorization. <br><br> Green also requested that two arc welders be delivered to the school, then removed one of them and had her husband transport it to her home without authorization. <br><br> She then asked a teacher to mislead an investigator in relation to her taking the welder to her home. After the teacher refused to mislead the investigator, Green facilitated a telephone call from her husband to the same teacher in which the investigation was again discussed. <br><br> The removal of these items became the subject of a police investigation and Green was charged with theft, although the charges were subsequently withdrawn. <br><br> After the charges were withdrawn, she sent an accusatory text message to the teacher indicating that because of the teacher’s statement, Green’s employer wanted to fire her. <br><br> Following a board’s investigation, Green received a letter of reprimand, a five-day suspension without pay and was deemed to no longer be eligible to hold a position of responsibility. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that she appear before the panel to receive a reprimand immediately after the hearing. <br><br> In addition, Green was directed to complete, at her own expense, a pre-approved course of instruction on ethical behaviour. <br><br> In its written decision, members of the panel said that “the reprimand is appropriate in the circumstances. It allows the profession to express its concerns to the member about her misconduct.” <br><br> ","Member:  Stephan Sebastian Howard Registration No:  138559 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Toronto District School Board principal Stephan Sebastian Howard and ordered his certificate be suspended with conditions in connection with a criminal conviction for misappropriation of funds. <br><br> Howard, who was certified to teach in June 1990, attended the public hearing on November 20, 2014, with his legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that from 2004 to 2009, Howard authorized some inappropriate expenditure of funds that were not used for their intended purpose. For example, the school advisory council donated over $56,000 and gave specific directions for its use. About $35,700 was used as directed but some items — including the purchase of alcoholic beverages for staff events and payments for school staff members on leave —were not. <br><br> On October 13, 2009, the board superintendent directed Howard to be sent home pending an investigation. Howard submitted his resignation for the purpose of retirement on February 28, 2010. <br><br> In May 2013, he pleaded guilty for misappropriation of funds contrary to the Criminal Code. Howard paid $29,448.24 to the board in restitution. He received a conditional discharge and 12 months of probation. <br><br> Based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, an agreed statement of facts, a joint submission on penalty, a guilty plea, and the submissions made by legal counsel, the panel found Howard guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to suspend his Certificate of Qualification and Registration for 18 months starting on November 20, 2014. <br><br> Furthermore, Howard was ordered to appear before the panel following the hearing to receive a reprimand, and required to successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course of instruction covering professional ethics, which he has since completed. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “It was the member’s responsibility to manage non-board funds ethically, to keep and maintain proper accounting records and to ensure that the funds were used for the intended purposes, namely student programs and activities. The member failed to do so on a consistent basis.” <br><br> ","Member:  David Khac Nhan Lang Registration No:  527241 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of David Khac Nhan Lang for engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a student. <br><br> Lang, who was certified to teach in June 2008, did not attend the public hearing on December 15, 2014, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that Lang had an inappropriate relationship with a student whom he taught in the 2010-11 academic year. In the 2011-12 academic year, he was teaching at another school and no longer taught the student however, he continued to have a romantic relationship with her. <br><br> They saw each other about three to five times per week at parks, hotels, in his car or at the student’s home while her parents were away. They engaged in sexual touching and drank alcohol together. Over 9,000 text messages had been exchanged between the two from October 2011 to May 2012. <br><br> In May 2012, the student’s mother spoke with administrators at the board and the Children’s Aid Society. <br><br> The panel found Lang guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration.

She also purchased a D-Link modem for $109.98 using the school fund. <br><br> During an assignment at Spanish Public School, she used the board’s Purolator courier account for personal use, and purchased a few personal items in a grocery store while shopping for the school. <br><br> In February 2013, she was assigned to home duties with pay following a board investigation, and she resigned from the board in May 2013. <br><br> Based on the evidence, a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a joint submission on resolution and submissions made by both counsel, the Discipline Committee panel ratified the MOA and found the member guilty of professional misconduct. She was ordered to complete, at her own expense, a course on professional ethics. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “It was the member’s responsibility as principal to manage funds ethically, and to keep and maintain proper accounting records.” The panel found that “the member was not transparent in her practices, nor did she seek advice or guidance to ensure appropriate procedures were followed.” <br><br> ","Member:  Daniel James Meeker, OCT Registration No:  253772 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed Daniel James Meeker, a teacher of the Thames Valley District School Board, to receive a reprimand for making harassing comments to a female colleague over a 12-month period. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 1989, did not attend the December 10, 2014, hearing but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> During the 2006–07 school year, Meeker engaged in a romantic relationship with a female colleague that ended in or before 2007. During or around the period of October 2007 to September 2008, Meeker repeatedly engaged in behaviour toward this colleague that made her feel very uncomfortable at work, including:  making repeated telephone calls to her home and her cellphone; and asking one or more co-workers “is he dead yet?” — referring to the colleague’s spouse who had suffered a brain hemorrhage. <br><br> In November 2008, the female colleague reported allegations of harassment to the police. Criminal charges against Meeker were ultimately dismissed. His employment was terminated by the board in May 2009. Meeker successfully grieved his termination and, in September 2012, returned to teaching. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, a statement of uncontested facts, a joint submission on penalty, a plea of no contest, and legal submissions. The member was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. As well, the member was ordered to complete a pre-approved course, at his own expense, on professional boundaries with colleagues, professional ethics and peer relationships. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said that the course “will serve to rehabilitate and educate the member.” <br><br> ","Member:  Raymonde Marie-Lourdes Racines, OCT Registration No:  478370 Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed Raymonde Marie-Lourdes Racines, a teacher of the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud, to receive a reprimand for failing to properly supervise the students for whom she was responsible. <br><br> Racines, who was certified to teach in June 2004, attended the December 12, 2014, hearing and was represented by a lawyer. <br><br> During the 2010–11 school year, Racines failed to properly supervise students in her classroom. The school principal reported to the Children’s Aid Society (CAS) some troubling situations in which students had injured other students while they were in the member’s care. The CAS concluded that Racines had limited competence in the provision of care, endangering a child placed under her professional supervision. <br><br> The board terminated her employment on March 9, 2011. Based on the evidence, a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a guilty plea, a joint submission on resolution, and legal submissions, the Discipline Committee panel ratified the MOA and found the member guilty of professional misconduct. She was ordered to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “As a teacher, it is the member’s duty to maintain a healthy physical, emotional and social learning environment for her students.” <br><br> ","Member:  Lucie Robitaille Registration No:  261134 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the teaching certificate of Lucie Robitaille, a former teacher of the Conseil scolaire de district catholique du Nouvel-Ontario, for showing significant deficiencies in her teaching practice. <br><br> Examples of deficiencies include:  <br><br> Robitaille, who was certified to teach in June 1989, was not represented by a lawyer and did not attend the hearings that were held on September 29 and 30, 2014. <br><br> During the 2008–09 academic year, Robitaille disregarded the principal’s requests for changes in her teaching practice and demonstrated no significant improvements in her performance. <br><br> On March 23, 2009, she was suspended with pay. The board terminated her employment two months later on May 19, 2009. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Robitaille guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, and legal submissions by College counsel. <br><br> The panel ordered that her teaching certificate be suspended for one month and that she appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, she was directed to enrol, at her own expense, in one or more courses covering the areas of deficiency, at the College Registrar’s discretion. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “The profession must expose the type of conduct displayed by the member. Although it is unusual to make an order for both a suspension and a reprimand in the same case … the fact that she had support from her employer but decided to defy the latter’s instructions prompted the Committee to make an order for both of these penalties simultaneously.” <br><br> ","Member:  Salvatore Scolaro, OCT Registration No:  461628 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed Salvatore Scolaro, a transportation technology teacher of the Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board, to receive a reprimand for mismanaging school funds. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in December 2002, attended the November 10, 2014, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Between September 2006 and June 2009, Scolaro used school funds — intended to support a program for students — to purchase auto parts for repairs on his vehicle and those of his family. He eventually reimbursed the school for these purchases but only after an audit was performed pointing out the irregularities. <br><br> He received a written reprimand by the school board. The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct based on the evidence, onus and standard of proof, a statement of uncontested facts, a plea of no contest, a joint submission on penalty, and legal submissions.

As well, the member was ordered to complete a pre-approved course, at his own expense, on professional ethics and record-keeping, which he has completed. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said that “the member’s unprofessional behaviour contributed to a significant deficit in the budget for the course ... the member’s actions as a teacher were completely unacceptable.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed a male teacher to receive a reprimand for making inappropriate comments to students and derogatory comments regarding the teaching practices of his colleagues. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in August 2001, attended the November 27, 2014, hearing and was represented by a lawyer. <br><br> During the 2010–11 school year, parents and students expressed their concerns to the school administration regarding the member’s mistreatment of students. In particular, they reported that the member:  <br><br> The Jewish Family & Child Service conducted an investigation and concluded that the allegations were substantiated. <br><br> The member received a number of disciplinary actions by the board including home assignment, transfer and suspension. He was also required to complete a course on classroom management and complete anger management counselling sessions — which he completed successfully. <br><br> Based on the exhibits, a memorandum of agreement (MOA), a joint submission on resolution, a plea of no contest, and legal submissions, the Discipline Committee panel ratified the MOA and found the member guilty of professional misconduct. He was ordered to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> The panel also carefully considered the submissions of the parties with respect to publication with or without the name of the member in this section of the magazine.

She was ordered to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand, and was required to successfully complete, at her own expense, a pre-approved course of instruction in ethics. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “As a vice-principal, the member was in a position of trust and added responsibility. The member had a duty to serve as a leader and role model for the students, teachers and the parents of her school, as well as the larger community and to manage funds ethically and to maintain proper accounting records. The member failed in this duty.”","Member:  André Bédard, OCT Registration No:  283851 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered that André Bédard, a teacher from the Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est, be reprimanded for abusing students verbally and physically. <br><br> Bédard, who was certified to teach in April 1994, did not attend the public hearing on March 5, 2015, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that numerous inappropriate incidents happened during the 2008–09 and 2009–10 school years including:  <br><br> The member was subsequently transferred to another school following complaints from the students’ parents. <br><br> The panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to appear before the panel on July 7, 2015, to receive a reprimand, and required that he successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course on anger management and maintaining appropriate boundaries within four months of the order. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “The member failed to maintain the standards of the teaching profession by abusing students verbally and physically, which would reasonably be regarded by members, as disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional.” <br><br> ","Member:  Guy Boissonneault, OCT Registration No:  439867 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board teacher Guy Boissonneault for physically abusing a student. <br><br> Boissonneault, who was certified to teach in October 2000, attended the public hearing on June 15, 2015, with his legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that, in 2013, he grabbed a student and pushed him against the handrail of a portable for a maximum of 15 seconds to put an end to inappropriate behaviour by the student, who continued to hit him in the behind, despite the member’s repeated directives.

She received a conditional discharge. <br><br> Her employment was terminated by that board. The termination was grieved and, in 2007, the parties settled the grievance on the basis that the member resign from the board. She was found guilty of professional misconduct by a Discipline Committee panel of the College in November 2008. <br><br> In 2009 and 2010, Davidson applied for various teaching positions with the York Region District School Board and falsified information in her application and during an interview about her employment termination and her criminal charges. In 2009, she was hired as an occasional teacher by the board and was hired again in 2012 to complete two long-term teaching positions. <br><br> In December 2012, Davidson intentionally tripped a young student who was hurt during the incident by hitting his face on the ground.

For example:  <br><br> The panel found Foucault guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “The member’s egregious conduct negatively impacted students and staff, and occurred repeatedly over the course of several months, in the face of repeated complaints from staff.

He continued to engage in similar behaviour at another school during the two following years. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for one month, starting on January 14, 2015, and that he appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Grant was directed to complete a course of instruction in professional boundaries and boundary violation issues at his own expense. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “[His] lack of judgment was made apparent by his continued and ongoing misconduct and disregard for the previous warnings he received from the board.” <br><br> ","Member:  Clinton Jeffery Hockin, OCT Registration No:  420510 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Clinton Jeffery Hockin, a teacher of the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board, for engaging in a pattern of misconduct. <br><br> Hockin, who was certified to teach in July 1998, attended the February 20, 2015, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The misconduct — which happened during the 2012–13 school year — included disregard toward female students by making demeaning and offensive comments, sharing with students inappropriate personal information, binding a student with masking tape, playing songs with inappropriate lyrics, calling students names and making reference to sexual orientation, and making inappropriate comments to colleagues that could be heard by students. <br><br> Following the board’s investigation, Hockin was suspended for three days without pay at the start of the 2013–14 school year and transferred to another school in the board. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that he appear before the panel to receive a reprimand immediately after the hearing. <br><br> In addition, Hockin was directed to complete a course of instruction, at his own expense, in adolescent development and professional boundaries with students. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that “classroom discussions should not have a negative impact on students, especially young students who are easily influenced. The incidents above clearly demonstrate the member’s lack of good judgment. Even if the member, in some instances, recognized the inappropriateness of his behaviour and attempted to fix the situation, the committee is concerned that he repeatedly made poor decisions.” <br><br> ","Member:  Charles Thomas Jennings Registration No:  216260 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board teacher Charles Thomas Jennings related to a criminal conviction for sexually assaulting a female student. <br><br> Licensed to teach in June 1993, Jennings did not attend the February 17, 2015, hearing nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Jennings met the student on a class trip in March 2012 and they began texting one another and spending time together.

Another student disputed Kellington’s claim, which led her to accuse the student of being a bully as well, angrily opened the passenger door and physically removed her from her car and drove away. <br><br> Later in the evening, the member’s serious and impulsive behaviour continued upon arrival at the party. When she saw the student she believed was bullying her daughter, she began moving toward her with a pointed finger and started yelling, swearing and grabbing the student by the collar and vigorously shook her while screaming obscenities. Kellington pushed the student causing her to hit her head against a glass door. She repeated this action a second time. <br><br> Kellington’s board suspended her without pay for 30 days.

As well, the member was ordered to complete a pre-approved course, at his own expense, on ethics and responsibilities of administrators. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “By sending personal, intimate emails and communications using the board’s email account, the member failed to comply with this guideline [the board’s guideline] … By engaging in a personal, intimate conversation with a person outside the school using Skype, his actions were rash and, as such, could damage public trust in the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Luc Bernard Lemieux Registration No:  428030 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of Luc Bernard Lemieux, a teacher of the Conseil scolaire Viamonde, for sexual abuse. <br><br> Lemieux, who was certified to teach in May 1999, was represented by legal counsel and attended the hearings held on April 24, 29, 30 and May 21, 2014, and January 19, 20 and March 31, 2015. <br><br> Starting in 2004 and over the next six school years, Lemieux made numerous remarks of a sexual nature toward several students including:  <br><br> In addition, his relationships with five students were overly familiar and exceeded the boundaries between teacher and student. He demonstrated favouritism by giving them gifts, such as silver necklaces, a stuffed bear holding a heart reading “Just say yes,” a bouquet of white roses and money. He was also lending students his debit card and cellphone, sending them numerous personal texts and emails, and inviting them to lunch during school hours. <br><br> Lemieux also suggested to female students belonging to a team to wear only a sports bra during one practice and encouraged a student, in front of the class, to take off a sweater she was wearing under a see-through jacket. <br><br> In the 2011–12 school year, he was reassigned to another school with the board, and there have been no other complaints or allegations of inappropriate conduct since then. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for 18 months as of July 1, 2015, and that he appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Lemieux was directed to complete a course of instruction in maintaining appropriate boundaries and supervising students at his own expense. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “It is essential that teachers be familiar with the boundaries that must be maintained in their relationships with students.

He was sentenced to three years’ incarceration. <br><br> College Counsel submitted that McLeod’s conduct was one of the most egregious cases of abuse brought before the College. <br><br> The panel found McLeod guilty of professional misconduct, and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel reported that “College Counsel submitted that the member ‘cannot hide by resigning before these proceedings’ and ‘the College will not shield members of the profession.’ Counsel for the College emphasized the importance of transparency as it was through publicity of this case that six additional victims came forward.” <br><br> ","Member:  Olga Alexsandrovna Piatnitsa Registration No:  504647 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Olga Alexsandrovna Piatnitsa, a former teacher at the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board, for physically assaulting a child. <br><br> Licensed to teach in January 2007, she did not attend the May 25, 2015, hearing nor was she represented by legal counsel. <br><br> During 2009–10, over a six-month period, Piatnitsa assaulted a child on multiple occasions. The abuse resulted in multiple bruises on the child’s body that were inflicted by slapping, punching, pinching and using a belt. <br><br> In March 2012, she was convicted of assault and sentenced to four months in jail and two years’ probation. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found her guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke her Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “The member, as a result of her conduct, has forfeited the privilege of holding a teaching certificate and being a member of the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Harry Pott, OCT Registration No:  141513 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Harry Pott, a former teacher at the Upper Canada District School Board, for inappropriate social media communications. <br><br> Pott, who was certified to teach in July 1984, attended the hearing on October 14, 2014. He was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In August 2011, Pott engaged in a conversation with a student on Facebook. They chatted about drinking at Pott’s house and having students of the school over to Pott’s home to drink. The member gave the student his home address and telephone number. <br><br> His principal sent Pott a disciplinary letter in 2012. In January 2014, he retired from his employment as a teacher. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that he appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Pott was directed to complete a course of instruction in appropriate boundaries, at his own expense, prior to commencing any position requiring a Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> ","Member:  Carmel Rouhani Registration No:  620009 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Near North District School Board former teacher Carmel Rouhani for engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a female student. <br><br> Rouhani, who was certified to teach in June 2011, did not attend the public hearing on March 23, 2015, nor was she represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that during the 2011–12 school year, Rouhani and her student began to communicate very frequently. During the summer of 2012, they had developed a personal relationship, which continued during the 2012–13 school year. They communicated electronically on a very frequent basis and met outside the school. <br><br> One day, Rouhani — with the student’s mother’s consent — had the student for an overnight stay. Subsequently, the student’s mother became concerned about the relationship with Rouhani and the student’s father asked Rouhani to “wean herself off” his daughter as he believed his daughter was too attached to the member. Despite the parents’ warning and Rouhani’s assurance to cease the relationship, she continued the relationship with the student. <br><br> On May 2013, the student’s mother alerted the Ontario Provincial Police and an investigation began. <br><br> The investigation revealed that Rouhani and the student had exchanged about 35,000 text messages between June 2012 and March 2013. The police found that the messages transitioned from being a friendly conversation that one would expect between two teenage girls who cared for one another and who were devastated by the thought of not being able to speak, to messages of a nature that the police felt were an indication that the relationship was more than just friendship. The nature of the text messages became increasingly sexual and included comments such as, “The whole point of me getting into bed with u was to keep u warm.” <br><br> The panel found Rouhani guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke her Certificate of Qualification and Registration. The panel found that Rouhani “was given numerous opportunities to end the inappropriate relationship with the student but failed to do so. The Committee finds that this, coupled with the member’s repeated pattern of lying and numerous text messages with sexual content, demonstrated that she did not take her teaching duties seriously.” <br><br> ","Member:  Paul Christopher Sabol Registration No:  400955 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Toronto District School Board teacher Paul Christopher Sabol for showing inappropriate material to his students in the context of an art lesson. <br><br> Sabol, who was certified to teach in June 1991, attended the April 9, 2015, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> On more than one occasion in 2007 and 2008, Sabol showed inappropriate material to his students. During one incident, he warned his students about the mature theme of numerous postcards he had on display in the classroom, in relation to an activity, and advised them that they did not have to participate if viewing the postcards made them uncomfortable. <br><br> The Discipline Committee was concerned with Sabol’s inappropriate choice of teaching material and his failure to recognize that his teaching material should not include sensual, provocative or explicit nude images. <br><br> Although Sabol believed that the inappropriate content served a pedagogical purpose, the committee finds that he exercised poor judgment and did not consider the sensitivity of young school children. <br><br> In 2009, his board suspended him for 25 days without pay and directed him to complete professional counselling and coursework. He was also placed in an interim assignment at a new location for the remainder of the school year. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for 25 days. This suspension is to be recorded on the public register. He was also directed to appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Sabol was directed to complete a course of instruction on adolescent development and professional boundaries with students at his own expense. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that “the reprimand of the member by his peers in respect of his inappropriate conduct serves to emphasize the necessity to maintain the appropriate professional standards set by the College.” <br><br> ","Member:  Johanne Ste-Croix Registration No:  453908 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended Johanne Ste-Croix, a former teacher at the Conseil des écoles publiques de l’Est de l’Ontario, for engaging in an inappropriate personal relationship with a student. <br><br> Ste-Croix, who was certified to teach in June 2002, attended the hearing held on May 5, 2015, and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> During the 2010–11 academic year, Ste-Croix regularly communicated with a student via email, text message and telephone. On numerous occasions, she met with him outside the school. The meetings consisted of having him sleep at her home and visiting him at his home. <br><br> On one occasion, the student told his grandmother that Ste-Croix thought she was his girlfriend, but he did not want her as his girlfriend. The grandmother ultimately relayed this information and her own observations to the student’s parents. The parents reported the matter to the police. <br><br> Ste-Croix was suspended by her board for three months. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that her teaching certificate be suspended for three months. She was also directed to appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Ste-Croix was directed to complete a course of instruction with an emphasis on boundary violations, at her own expense. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “The member crossed the professional teaching boundaries governed by the College, and this committee finds the member’s behaviour to be disgraceful and dishonourable.” <br><br> ","Member:  Laura Rae Thompson Registration No:  621867 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of College member Laura Rae Thompson for failing to maintain appropriate boundaries with a male student. <br><br> Thompson, who was certified to teach in July 2011, did not attend the February 19, 2015, hearing nor was she represented by legal counsel. <br><br> On December 26, 2012, Thompson sent an email message to a student stating, among other things, that she wanted to be with him and that she loved him. She told him that he was “the most incredible person” and that she loved him “more than she has ever loved anything, and always will … forever.” <br><br> The member admitted that she sent a nude picture of herself to a former student of the school upon his request. <br><br> Thompson was suspended with pay in February 2013 and her employment was terminated early March 2013. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that her teaching certificate be suspended for one month starting on February 19, 2015, and that she appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Thompson was directed to complete a course of instruction in appropriate boundaries and boundary violation at her own expense. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said that it “does not accept the member’s explanation that she was intoxicated and under emotional distress at the time of writing and sending the mail … The member’s ” conduct clearly displays her failure to understand appropriate student-teacher boundaries, which in these circumstances, should have been apparent.” <br><br> ","Member:  Francis Patrick Ubertelli Registration No:  523850 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of College member Francis Patrick Ubertelli for making inappropriate comments that were offensive, discriminatory and inconsistent with the standards of the profession.

She was also directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> The panel ordered that she successfully complete, at her own expense, a course of instruction on professional boundaries. <br><br> In its written decision, the committee panel stated that “The committee is concerned with the member’s inability to establish appropriate professional boundaries in her relationships with student No. 1, student No. 2 and student No. 3.” <br><br> ","Member:  Gilbert Ignatios (Ian) McIntyre Registration No:  245962 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the teaching certificate of Gilbert Ignatios (Ian) McIntyre for repeatedly sexually harassing a new teacher and using his senior position at the school to pursue a relationship with her. <br><br> McIntyre, a former teacher with the Toronto District School Board, was certified to teach in June 1974. He was present at his hearing on January 27, 2010, but did not attend, nor was he represented by legal counsel at his hearing on July 26, 2010. <br><br> During the 2001–02 school year, McIntyre acted in an inappropriate manner toward a first-year probationary teacher. He frequently entered and disrupted her classroom. He pursued an unwanted kiss, by forcing himself on her at her home. He discredited her spouse and encouraged her to leave him. He used a false pretext — that he had important staffing information relevant to her — to lure her to have coffee with him, and then gave her a “love poem.” She stated in her testimony she felt threatened by the member and that he was stalking her. <br><br> McIntyre was dismissed by the school board on May 2, 2003. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be suspended for three months and that he receive a reprimand. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “The Committee considers unprofessional interactions between colleagues as serious. In view of the power imbalance between the member and [colleague], the Committee finds this ongoing sexual harassment by the member even more egregious.” <br><br> ","Member:  Amy Louise Mullins Registration No:  418058 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Amy Louise Mullins for the sexual abuse of a student and other acts of professional misconduct. <br><br> Mullins, a former high school teacher with the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board, was certified to teach in June 1998. The hearing took place January 18–20, January 25–26, February 7–9, May 25–26, May 30–31, June 9 and September 20–21 in 2011, and on March 8, 2012. She attended all the hearing dates and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> From 2001–03, Mullins had a sexual relationship with a male student. She allowed students in her care to engage in sexual acts. She placed herself in a compromising situation in hotel rooms. She provided, paid for and tolerated alcohol consumption while students were in her care. She continued contact with a student even after forbidden to do so by his parents. She allowed students to stay at her home without their parents’ knowledge or approval. She shared a hotel bed with male students in various states of undress. <br><br> The school board suspended Mullins in December 2006. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Mullins guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that her Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> Mullins filed a Notice of Appeal to the Ontario Divisional Court on June 4, 2012. The appeal was dismissed on April 22, 2014. <br><br> In its decision, the Discipline Committee panel wrote:  “The nature of the misconduct demanded the most serious of penalties. The misconduct was so extreme in its nature and of such reprehension that revocation was the only acceptable penalty.” Revocation ensures that the member “not be under any illusion about the impact of her behaviour on those who she has harmed, and the damage to the honour of the profession.” <br><br> General deterrence is achieved by publication with the member’s name, the panel said. “The profession in general needs to know what happens when members lose their moral compass and ignore the expectations of ethical behaviour rightly placed on them by society and their peers.” <br><br> In conclusion, the panel wrote, “The member’s behaviour was more than just unfortunate, it was egregious and well beneath the standards of the profession or for that matter, anybody entrusted with the care and guidance of children and young people.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded a former teacher at Algoma District School Board for having a pattern of unprofessional behaviour. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 2002, attended the public hearing on June 8, 2015, with his legal counsel. <br><br> In 2013, he did not perform his duties while teaching at his school. One incident involved sending the only student in his classroom to the library to be supervised by another teacher. The second incident involved the member using a computer in the staff workroom when he was supposed to be on hall duty. The final incident involved a student being assaulted in the classroom while the member was outside of the classroom door talking to another teacher. <br><br> In 2014, the member voluntarily completed a course in classroom management. <br><br> The panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to appear before it immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand. It also directed the member to successfully complete, at his own expense, within 90 days of commencing employment where a Certificate of Qualification and Registration is required, a pre-approved course on classroom management. <br><br> ","Member:  Donovan Anthony Patterson, OCT Registration No:  196605 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Donovan Anthony Patterson, a former vice-principal from the DufferinPeel Catholic District School Board, for using board funds for his personal use. <br><br> Neither Patterson, who was certi- fied to teach in June 1994, nor his legal counsel attended the public hearing on October 3, 2014. <br><br> The panel heard that in 2012 he had misappropriated board funds when he used the board procurement credit card for personal use on seven occasions. <br><br> The board suspended the member with pay pending its investigation. Patterson subsequently resigned from his employment with the board after he provided a certified cheque of $561.51 in order to compensate it for the funds used for personal use. <br><br> The panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to appear before it within six months of the date of the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> It also directed the member to successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course on ethical behaviour. Patterson needs to successfully complete this course within three months of the hearing date or prior to seeking or engaging in employment where a Certificate of Qualification and Registration is required, whichever is later. <br><br> He was also directed not to assume any financial responsibilities in any employment where a certificate is required for a period of two years following the completion of the course. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “The member abused his powers as an administrator by accessing the board’s procurement credit card for his personal use on several occasions.” <br><br> ","Member:  Unidentified Decision:  Reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel directed a teacher of the Peel District School Board to receive a reprimand for failure to properly supervise his students. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in April 1982, attended the August 24, 2015, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In February 2012, he failed to adequately supervise five of his students on a neighbourhood walk, during which time, unbeknownst to the member, inappropriate sexual interactions took place between some of his students. <br><br> He received a letter of discipline from his board. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that he appear before it to receive a reprimand immediately after the hearing. <br><br> In its written decision, members of the panel said, “The Committee accepts that the member’s failure to supervise some of his students, on the occasion in question, was an isolated incident.” <br><br> ","Member:  Michael Grant Slater Registration No:  311476 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Michael Grant Slater, a former teacher employed by the Carleton Board of Education and/or the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board for sexually abusing two male students. <br><br> Slater, who was certified to teach in June 1965, did not attend the public hearing on August 24, 2015, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Between September 1968 and June 1984, Slater committed sexual offences against two male students while he was a teacher at the students’ school. In 2014, he was found guilty of one count of indecent assault, three counts of gross indecency and one count of buggery. He was sentenced to three years incarceration. <br><br> The panel found him guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel said, “The member’s conduct has also adversely impacted the public’s trust in the teaching profession as not only did the member prey on children, but he used his classroom as a ‘hunting ground.’” <br><br> ","Member:  Yves Étienne Tourigny, OCT Registration No:  482309 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Yves Étienne Tourigny, a teacher at the Conseil des écoles publiques de l’Est de l’Ontario, for inappropriate conduct with four female students at his school. <br><br> Tourigny, who was certified to teach in August 2004, attended the hearing on December 16, 2008. He was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Tourigny admitted that he engaged in inappropriate conduct during the 2004–05 school year. The interactions included sending an email to one student, writing that she and another female student were granted more privileges because they were pretty, nice and quiet in the classroom. He jokingly told another student that if she didn’t wear her long hair down, he would give her a detention. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that he appear before it after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> Tourigny was also directed to complete the Knowing Barriers, Respecting Limits – Module 1 course at his own expense within six months. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “The member’s conduct with regard to the contraventions alleged against and admitted by him was highly inappropriate.

The panel also directed that the College public registry state that he undertakes to refrain from occupying again any position requiring a Certificate of Qualification and Registration from the College, and to never seek reinstatement of his certificate. <br><br> In its decision, the panel said, “Although the characters in his novel are fictional, the public’s perception of a member of the College who describes sexual scenes involving young students is extremely negative. The novel did in fact stir up controversy in the school community, which resulted in a harmful image of the teaching profession and its members.” <br><br> ","Member:  William Robert Wallace Registration No:  102837 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of William Robert Wallace, a former teacher at the Carleton Board of Education, for sexually assaulting a student. <br><br> Licensed to teach in June 1974, Wallace did not attend the hearing on May 1, 2015.

Gerwin also disregarded the mother’s request that he cease contact with the student outside school activities. <br><br> In the fall of 2010, Gerwin continued to spend time with the student both in school and outside school hours.

She used inappropriate language (some of a racist nature) and breached confidentiality about student information. <br><br> In one incident, she sent a student back to his seat and said, “he’s Chinese or whatever,” which suggested to a parent volunteer in the class that this was the reason the child did not understand what she was trying to communicate to him.

He did provide written submissions to the committee. <br><br> Two of the males were former students of the school while the third was a student at the school. <br><br> In April 2011, Dempster took a student to dinner without his family. The member and the family were friends. In February 2012, Dempster was at the student’s family home for dinner. After dinner, they all decided to go into the hot tub. He and the student undressed and changed into bathing suits while alone in the student’s bedroom. <br><br> From January 2008 to March 2012, Dempster had an inappropriate personal relationship with another student. He bought items for the student, took him snowboarding and to the movies, chatted on Facebook and texted him to “hang out.” When the student started high school, they “hung out” alone about twice a month. <br><br> During the 2011–12 school year, Dempster took a third student for haircuts, to the movies, skating, a play, dinner, and they edited movies together. <br><br> Dempster resigned from the school board on June 30, 2012. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found him guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. The panel noted Dempster’s repeated pattern of inappropriate behaviour toward young male students was “very troubling.” <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “Although the Committee is aware that the member would say, if he were to testify, that these relationships developed through his personal relationships with the students’ parents, he ought to have known that members of the teaching profession are to conduct themselves in a professional manner both inside and outside of the classroom. These relationships were not within the scope of appropriate teacher-student relationships.” <br><br> ","Member:  Réjean Desjardins Registration No:  261322 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended Conseil des écoles publiques de l’Est de l’Ontario teacher Réjean Desjardins for repeated dishonest conduct, including the theft of approximately $600 from a school’s small-cash box. <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1993, Desjardins attended the November 23, 2015, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Among other acts, Desjardins entered a school where he used to work, outside work hours and without permission, to take approximately $600 from the petty cash in a teacher’s room and a sports bag containing a pair of snowshoes. <br><br> The school board suspended Desjardins without pay and subsequently dismissed him on November 13, 2012. He eventually repaid the full amount taken from the cash box. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Desjardins guilty of professional misconduct and directed that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be suspended for three months. He was also ordered to appear before the committee immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “Although the mitigating factors demonstrate that the member has taken responsibility for his actions, this does not excuse the fact that his actions were very serious and undermined public trust in the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Nicole Desrosiers-Houde, OCT Registration No:  183420 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Conseil scolaire catholique du Nouvel-Ontario teacher Nicole Desrosiers-Houde for using physical force to discipline two students under her care. <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1985, Desrosiers-Houde did not attend the October 19, 2015, hearing but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> An investigation by the school board found that Desrosiers-Houde grabbed a student by the neck when he refused to put away a box of crayons when told to do so on November 14, 2011. The member stated she did not grab the student but merely touched his shoulder. <br><br> Desrosiers-Houde also smacked a student on the cheek after breaking up a scuffle between him and another student. The member stated that she stepped in to separate the students but denied smacking the boy. <br><br> The two incidents were reported to the Children’s Aid Society (CAS) of Algoma, which concluded that the incidents had occurred. The Ontario Provincial Police were briefed concerning the CAS investigations but no criminal charges were laid. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Desrosiers-Houde guilty of professional misconduct and directed that she appear before the committee to receive a reprimand within eight months of the hearing. <br><br> In addition, she must successfully complete, at her own expense, a course in the theory and practice of classroom management prior to returning to her current or any other teaching position. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “The committee is satisfied that the resolution in this matter is appropriate under the circumstances and serves and protects the public interest.” <br><br> ","Member:  Grant Gerhard Gedies, OCT Registration No:  438873 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Toronto District School Board teacher Grant Gerhard Gedies for making numerous inappropriate and offensive comments to six of his young students. <br><br> Certified to teach in October 2000, Gedies attended the November 20, 2015, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> During the 2010–11 school year, Gedies’s comments included calling students gay, cream puff, fat and crybaby. He told one student that “no one likes you.” When another student asked Gedies not to take a photo of him, he said, “I won’t. I don’t want my camera to break.” <br><br> Gedies received a warning letter and two suspensions from the school board as a result of his treatment of students. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Gedies guilty of professional misconduct and directed that he appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> Gedies must also successfully complete, at his own expense, a course in professional boundaries and respect for student sensitivities. <br><br> The Discipline Committee noted the repeated nature of the member’s misconduct, that he targeted many students with his insensitive comments, and that the board needed to intervene three times for Gedies to recognize his conduct was unacceptable. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “The member targeted students by insulting or demeaning them with a variety of comments that the member knew, or ought to have known, were discriminatory and hurtful. Through his actions, the member abused his position of trust and created an atmosphere that was not nurturing or conducive to building or maintaining students’ self-esteem.” <br><br> ","Member:  Kim Doris Gervais/ Kim Doris Brousseau Registration No:  426789 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Kim Doris Gervais, previously known as Kim Doris Brousseau, in connection with criminal convictions for sexually abusing four young male students. <br><br> Certified to teach in August 1999, Gervais did not attend the October 6, 2015, hearing, nor was she represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Gervais was a teacher with the Conseil scolaire catholique de district des Grandes Rivières in Timmins. Between September 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011, she engaged in inappropriate personal and sexual relationships with four students. <br><br> She sent text messages with sexual connotations, French kissed one student and showed photos of herself in various states of undress. She invited three students to her home to watch a porn video and invited two of them to fondle her breasts. <br><br> On April 23, 2014, she was sentenced to seven months in jail and two years of probation after pleading guilty to three counts of sexual interference and one count of invitation to sexual touching. <br><br> College counsel submitted that both her names be published because, according to her probation officer, the member moved to British Columbia and intends to change her name and return to a teaching career. “Publication of both of the member’s names is therefore necessary to protect the public interest.” <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Gervais guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that her certificate be revoked and both her names appear in the College magazine’s disciplinary summary. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “The member’s conduct towards young children was abhorrent and reprehensible. The member’s multiple, repeated acts of sexual misconduct warrant the Committee’s most severe penalty available:  an order of revocation.” <br><br> ","Member:  Peter David Giaschi Registration No:  458483 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended teacher Peter David Giaschi for inappropriate language, teaching techniques and interactions with colleagues, including offering erotic monologues for students to perform and using crude sexual language in class. <br><br> Giaschi, certified to teach in August 2002, was employed by the Hastings and Prince Edward District School Board. He did not attend the October 19, 2015, hearing but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> In September 2008, a female student performed an erotic monologue in front of the class. It was one of the options Giaschi offered to the class. He suggested she perform the monologue while lying on the floor and “having the best orgasm of her life.” <br><br> From September to December 2008, Giaschi made sexual references when instructing his students on how to act out a scene, rolled on the floor with students, including full-body contact, and performed the George Carlin monologue “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television.” <br><br> In May 2009, he confronted an occasional teacher about an issue in front of students and left his school computer open to a Facebook conversation that included inappropriate comments about school administrators. He posted inappropriate comments about school staff on his personal website. <br><br> Giaschi received discipline letters from the school and board and was suspended for a total of five days without pay. He also met with the board administration for a discipline meeting in November 2009 after he had a class participate in the re-enactment of a gang rape that occurred in California. <br><br> Giaschi resigned from the school board, effective April 1, 2010. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and suspended his teaching certificate for two months. He was also directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> Prior to returning to a teaching position, the reprimand must be delivered and Giaschi must successfully complete a course, at his own expense, regarding appropriate boundaries and boundary issues. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel described the member’s conduct as “disgraceful, dishonourable and unprofessional.” <br><br> ","Member:  Lisa Lynn Gillott, OCT Registration No:  538325 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Limestone District School Board teacher Lisa Lynn Gillott for inappropriate conduct and boundary violations with students despite warnings from the school administration and board. <br><br> Certified to teach in November 2008, Gillott attended the January 18, 2016, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Between January and May 2013, Gillott extended special privileges to a student, such as communicating with him via the Internet outside school hours and allowing him to stay inside during recess. <br><br> School administrators warned her regarding boundaries in the late spring of 2013, and the student’s parents asked that she “back off” in August 2013. <br><br> Gillott also made inappropriate disclosures regarding sexual activity to students during the 2012–13 school year. <br><br> Gillott was placed on administrative leave with pay in September 2013 pending the outcome of the board’s investigation into misconduct allegations. Family and Children’s Services investigated and had “not verified any child protection concerns.” <br><br> In October 2013, the school board suspended her for five days without pay, transferred her to a different school and advised that any further incidents of misconduct will result in her termination. She has taught successfully for two years. <br><br> Gillott attended three workshops dealing with professional boundaries and the use of social media in January 2014. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Gillott guilty of professional misconduct and directed that she appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> She must also successfully complete, at her own expense, a course in maintaining professional boundaries with students and the use of social media. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “The member’s conduct was serious and sustained over a significant period of time.” <br><br> ","Member:  Joseph Anthony Graziano Registration No:  274327 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board teacher Joseph Anthony Graziano who was criminally convicted of sexual offences against a student. <br><br> Certified to teach in August 1997, Graziano did not attend the December 16, 2015, hearing, nor was he represented by legal counsel. However, he made written submissions regarding the publication of his name. <br><br> Based on evidence in court documents, Graziano began grooming a student by assisting him on an exam in January 2011. He then told the student “you owe me” insinuating a sexual favour in exchange for the help provided. <br><br> On February 9, 2011, Graziano brought the student into his classroom under the guise of discussing the exam and engaged the student in a conversation of a sexual nature. He blocked the door to prevent the student from leaving and then touched the student’s penis over his clothes. <br><br> Graziano was found guilty of sexual interference and sexual assault in May 2013 and sentenced to six months in jail and two years of probation. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Graziano guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> In its decision, the panel wrote, “The member’s acts of sexual misconduct warrant an order of the Committee’s most severe penalty available:  revocation.” <br><br> ","Member:  Jennifer Elizabeth Green-Johnson Registration No:  187439 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended teacher Jennifer Elizabeth Green-Johnson for unprofessional behaviour toward her students, her use of profanity in the classroom and various inappropriate comments made to students. <br><br> Green-Johnson, employed by the Grand Erie District School Board, was certified to teach in June 1996. She attended the January 12, 2016, hearing and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The misconduct included telling her students in January 2011 that she had been “raped” and therefore did not trust men around her children. When one student jumped on another student’s back during play wrestling, she said words to the effect of “so you like it from behind.” <br><br> Between September 2011 and December 2011, Green-Johnson made inappropriate comments to students in her class, such as “stop bitching and sit down” and using the words “stupid” and “idiots.” <br><br> Green-Johnson served two school board suspensions without pay for her repeated misconduct. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Green-Johnson guilty of professional misconduct and suspended her certificate for one month.

To maintain his position on the board’s occasional teachers list, he was required to teach at least seven full days every five months during the 2011–12 and 2012–13 school years. <br><br> The Toronto Catholic District School Board employed Kopylov as a long-term occasional teacher for the entire 2011–12 school year. During this time, Kopylov took 11.5 personal illness days from the Toronto board to work as an occasional teacher for the Dufferin-Peel board. <br><br> Kopylov was paid by both boards for those 11.5 days.

During the trip, a group of four students did not board the return bus at the time specified by the member. <br><br> Eventually, Kissel asked the driver to move the bus a little further down the highway and, when it was safe to do so, to turn back to get the students. The driver drove until she reached a safe spot to turn the bus around, which was a couple of kilometres down the highway, around a curve, and out of the four students’ sight. It took the driver about seven to eight minutes to turn the bus around and return to the students. <br><br> As the bus approached, the four students held hands and stood across the middle of the highway. This action forced the bus driver to apply the brakes quickly and veer the bus away from them. The driver then moved the bus into a parking lot. <br><br> After exiting the bus, Kissel said to the students words to the effect of “when I say get on the f’ing bus, I mean get on the f’ing bus, so get on the f’ing bus.” <br><br> The board investigated the matter and Kissel received a two-day unpaid suspension. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Kissel guilty of professional misconduct and directed him to appear before the panel within 90 days of the date of its order to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Kissel was ordered to complete, at his own expense, a course of instruction in classroom management and student supervision.

For instance, he called students “little fuckers” and yelled at students to “shut up.” He called one student “fucking clueless” in front of the student’s class and yelled at another student to “get off his ass and clean the fucking shop.” <br><br> He was physically abusive to a student by taking hold of his neck and pushing his face into the table surface of a table saw. He threw a torch tip at another student. He endangered another student by positioning him near a grinder while Luke ground a piece of metal, thus causing sparks to fly into the student’s face. <br><br> Luke was suspended twice by his board in 2009 and, yet, in 2010, he committed several more acts of verbal, physical and psychological or emotional abuse toward students. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Luke guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “The member’s egregious misconduct spanned two academic years; involved multiple students; was repeated and escalated despite the Member receiving two warnings and two Board-imposed suspensions.

While at the home, a dispute and physical confrontation ensued between him and the woman, resulting in a call to the police. <br><br> He was charged with assault and forcible entry. The charges were later stayed in exchange for his entering into a peace bond. <br><br> The Director of Certification in British Columbia cancelled Luymes teaching certificate. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The panel ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for three months, starting on the date of its order, and that he appear before the panel to receive a reprimand.

He was directed to do so prior to starting a teaching position. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “Teachers are role models who must maintain the ethical standards of the teaching profession in their conduct in the community, and the Committee denunciates the Member’s misconduct in this case as disgraceful, dishonourable and unprofessional and as a conduct unbecoming a member of the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Not identified Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded a former vice-principal at the Toronto District School Board for accessing and setting up a new email account in someone else’s name. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 1985, attended the public hearing on April 5, 2016, with her legal counsel. <br><br> In 2011, the member used a colleague’s computer without permission, accessed the person’s email account and created a rule to forward any email that person received from specific colleagues to another email account. <br><br> She had done so after she inadvertently discovered that two colleagues were exchanging emails that contained disparaging statements about her. <br><br> The member was charged with mischief, unauthorized use of a computer and interception of private communications. <br><br> In 2012, the charges were withdrawn by the Crown after the member provided a written apology to her colleague as well as information about counselling she had undertaken and the 75 community service hours she had completed. <br><br> The panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and ordered her to appear before it immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. It also directed the member to successfully complete, at her own expense and prior to seeking or engaging in employment where a certificate is required, a pre-approved course on professional ethics. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, “The risk of repetition is minimized as the Member has retired and has taken steps, at her own expense, to address the concerns surrounding her misconduct. Given the circumstances, the Committee finds that publication with name would be unnecessarily punitive, would not provide additional deterrence value, and is not necessary to protect the interest of the public.” <br><br> ","Member:  Amanda Josephine O’Connor, OCT Registration No:  495998 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered a reprimand of Amanda Josephine O’Connor, a former teacher at the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board, for inappropriate physical contact toward a student. <br><br> O’Connor, who was certified to teach in September 2005, did not attend the hearing on February 25, 2016, but was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> During the 2013–14 school year, one of her students climbed onto furniture in the classroom and began to wrap a cord around his neck.

She held the student in this position for about one to three minutes until the student began to cry. <br><br> As a result, in October 2013, the board suspended O’Connor with pay pending the outcome of its investigation. <br><br> A month later, she was criminally charged but the charges were eventually stayed. <br><br> The Children’s Aid Society conducted an investigation and verified that the member used inappropriate physical force toward the student.

She was directed to appear before the committee to receive a reprimand. She needs to do so prior to starting a teaching position or any position for which a certificate is required. <br><br> She must also successfully complete, at her own expense, a course(s) regarding anger management and appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, “Members of the teaching profession, regardless of their personal circumstances, are all expected to treat students and staff with respect and to provide a safe learning environment.” <br><br> ","Member:  David Andrew Renn Registration No:  527319 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of David Andrew Renn, a Grand Erie District School Board former teacher, for repeated conduct toward students that formed a reprehensible pattern of behaviour. <br><br> Renn, who was certified to teach in January 2008, did not attend the public hearing on January 31, 2017, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that Renn sent inappropriate and sexually explicit text messages to a student, and knowing that it was unacceptable, asked that she delete these messages. <br><br> He also made inappropriate and lewd remarks containing sexual innuendo to the student in class, which made her feel uncomfortable. <br><br> He exchanged personal and inappropriate text messages with another student, in which he made reference to drinking and drugs, among other things. <br><br> The Children’s Aid Society investigated the allegations. It did not verify child protection concerns based on the ages of the students. However, the Society concluded that there is significant future risk regarding Renn in a position of authority as he did not show remorse or take any responsibility for his actions. <br><br> His employment with the board was subsequently terminated. <br><br> The panel found Renn guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “The Member’s conduct was abusive towards students and it jeopardized the public’s trust in the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Gary George Somerfield Registration No:  169611 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Gary George Somerfield, a former teacher at the Lakehead District School Board, for repeated episodes of inappropriate conduct in which he made a student feel frightened and uncomfortable. <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1986, Somerfield did not attend the hearing on October 13, 2016, and was not represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that Somerfield was alone in his classroom with a female student. He had closed the door. He showed the student a photograph of her, which the member downloaded from the student’s Instagram account, and asked her if it looked familiar. <br><br> The student asked him where he got the photograph and he stuck out his hand and said to her, “I’m Gary.” The student did not shake the member’s hand and felt confused. He asked her if what he did made sense and she said it did not. He then told her, “Well, we need to talk then.” She repeatedly asked why and he said that he could not tell the student at that time. <br><br> The student left his classroom. She cried and felt very uncomfortable with the exchange. Somerfield subsequently retired from the board. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Somerfield guilty of professional misconduct and directed that he appear before the committee to receive a reprimand. He needs to do so prior to commencing or returning to a teaching position or any position for which a Certificate of Qualification and Registration is required. <br><br> In addition, he must successfully complete, at his own expense, a course regarding appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues prior to commencing or returning to a teaching position. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, “Teachers are expected to provide a safe learning environment for students, but the Member did the opposite.” <br><br> ","Member:  William Douglas John White, OCT Registration No:  432924 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded William Douglas John White, a teacher at the Toronto District School Board, for repeated verbally and physically abusive conduct, despite having been previously counselled by his principal to model appropriate behaviour toward students and staff. <br><br> Certified to teach in November 2002, White attended the hearing on February 22, 2017, and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The inappropriate conduct included raising his voice and yelling at a student to get off the floor. <br><br> After the student refused the member’s request to take her seat and return to her assigned task, she sat down cross-legged on the floor. After she refused to get up, White put his left hand under her right armpit and put his right foot against her right thigh, as an attempt to pull her up off the floor. He pulled twice to lift her bottom off the floor; however, he was not able to lift her to her feet. <br><br> The student’s mother reported that her daughter had been complaining of a sore right arm since the incident. <br><br> The board suspended him for five days without pay. The suspension was reduced to two days following a grievance. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found White guilty of professional misconduct and directed that he appear before the committee immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. In addition, he must successfully complete, at his own expense, a course regarding anger management with a focus on dealing with students with special needs. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, <br><br> “Members of the profession are expected to treat students and staff with respect at all times.

She needs to do so prior to returning to teaching or taking any teaching position for which a Certificate of Qualification and Registration is required. <br><br> In addition, upon returning to a teaching position, she needs to make all reasonable efforts to have her employer carry out two teaching performance appraisals within two years after returning to teaching. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, \"The seriousness of the Member’s conduct in failing to teach her students diligently, and her refusal to improve her practice when support was given, indicate to the Committee that a reprimand is necessary. A reprimand allows the Committee to directly address with the Member the problem of her disengagement and disinterest in the improvement process.” <br><br> The panel added, “Given the Member’s failure to participate in the discipline process to date, the Member has shown a lack of accountability for her actions. The Committee has concerns regarding the Member’s governability, given her failure to engage in this process.” <br><br> ","Member:  Leanora Brown, OCT Registration No:  170623 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered Leanora Brown, a former teacher at the Toronto Catholic District School Board, to be reprimanded for:  <br><br> Brown, who was certified to teach in June 1987, did not attend the May 2, 2017, hearing, nor was she represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Brown guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that she appear before it to receive a reprimand.

She needs to do so prior to starting employment for which a Certificate of Qualification and Registration is required. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “By using profanity and racist language, insulting students, speaking explicitly about sex and her personal life, and engaging in inappropriate physical stretching, the Member did not act responsibly and respectfully in class.” <br><br> ","Member:  Richard S. Buckley Registration No:  438110 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of Richard Buckley, a former teacher with the Bluewater District School Board, for engaging in a sexualized relationship with a student. <br><br> This matter was heard by the panel on November 15 and 16, 2016, and April 6, 2017. Buckley, who was certified to teach in June 2000, did not attend the hearing but had legal representation. <br><br> Buckley tried to isolate the student by asking her to meet privately and go for a drive. When he was hospitalized due to mental illness, he told the student that he was going to kill himself. He also pressured her to cover up their relationship, which started via text message and/or Facebook. <br><br> The College previously found Buckley guilty of harassing a colleague. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Buckley guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for 24 months. He was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. He needs to do so within six months of the date of the order. <br><br> It also ordered him to successfully complete, at his own expense and within 90 days of the panel’s order, a course or courses regarding the College’s ethical standards of care, respect, trust and integrity, and maintaining professional boundaries with students. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “The Member used his position as a teacher to exert his influence over a student. He acted in a manner which would reasonably have made the student feel that she was responsible for the Member’s life or death. Such severe emotional blackmail was a gross violation of the Member’s duty to safeguard his students’ psychological well-being.” <br><br> ","Member:  Genevieve Huguette Emmanuelle Charlton-Rogers Registration No:  506691 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Genevieve Huguette Emmanuelle Charlton-Rogers, a former teacher with the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic District School Board, for engaging in a romantic and sexual relationship with a female student. <br><br> Licensed to teach in June 2006, she did not attend the hearing on April 25, 2017, nor was she represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found her guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke her Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “Revocation will reinforce to the profession and to the public the importance of maintaining appropriate student/teacher boundaries, and that inappropriate conduct of this nature will not be tolerated.” <br><br> ","Member:  Heather Elizabeth Earl Registration No:  165174 Decision:  Revocation, reprimand <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Heather Elizabeth Earl, a former teacher with the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board, for sexually abusing a student. <br><br> Earl engaged in a sexual relationship with a student for nearly three years.

Germundson, who was certified to teach in June 2014, attended part of the hearing remotely via a video link. He did not have legal representation. <br><br> His inappropriate and personal communications occurred repeatedly and involved young students. They continued even after the member’s employment was terminated for engaging in similar behaviour. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found him guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for one month. He was directed to appear before it to receive a reprimand. He needs to do so prior to starting a teaching position or any position for which a Certificate of Qualification and Registration is required. <br><br> The panel also ordered him to successfully complete, at his own expense, a course on appropriate boundaries and boundary violation issues. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “Members of the profession hold positions of trust and authority, and it is inappropriate for them to engage in personal communications about their private lives or other subjects with students that would not be appropriately discussed in a school or school-related setting.” <br><br> ","Member:  Angela Anita Grogan Registration No:  291737 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the teaching certificate of Angela Anita Grogan for falsely reporting that a male colleague had physically abused and inappropriately touched a female student. <br><br> Grogan, employed by the Toronto District School Board, was certified to teach in July 1984. The hearing took place on November 1, 12, 13, 15 and December 2 in 2013, January 13, April 1–2 and October 17 in 2014, and on October 23, 2015. <br><br> The member attended all the hearing dates and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The College called 11 witnesses, including school administrators, teachers, educational assistants and a school board representative. The panel found that during the 2008–09 academic year, Grogan falsely reported to school administrators in separate incidents that a colleague had:  <br><br> Grogan was on medical leave until her intended retirement in June 2016. <br><br> The panel found her guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that her Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> The panel also found that Grogan inappropriately called her colleague a liar in front of staff and students, but it made no finding of professional misconduct because this was an isolated incident. <br><br> Grogan filed a Notice of Appeal in relation to the finding of professional misconduct to the Ontario Divisional Court on May 28, 2015. Her appeal was subsequently dismissed. <br><br> While the panel acknowledged that it’s very important to encourage teachers to report all incidents of abuse where a teacher has a reasonably held suspicion that a student needs protection, the Committee found no evidence that Grogan had reasonable grounds to suspect that any abuse had occurred in this case. <br><br> The panel noted that members of the profession need not worry that they, too, may have their certificates revoked if they follow through on their duty to report, provided that they have a reasonably held belief that a student is in need of protection. <br><br> Revocation is being ordered in this case to address the member’s egregious conduct. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, “The Member had levelled groundless accusations of physical and sexual abuse against (a colleague), which were both stigmatizing and career-threatening.” <br><br> Members of the panel also noted that “false reporting can be extremely damaging,” and that this was not the type of behaviour that the duty to report seeks to encourage. <br><br> ","Member:  Raymond Hubbard Registration No:  192905 Decision:  Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of Raymond Hubbard, a former teacher with the Durham District School Board. Hubbard was convicted of child luring leading to an invitation to sexual touching with a person he believed to be 14 years old. <br><br> Licensed to teach in June 1994, Hubbard did not attend the hearing on April 24, 2017, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that Hubbard began to converse through Facebook and Kik with a person who he believed to be a 14-year-old girl. She was in fact an undercover police officer. The conversations, which included over 1,700 messages, involved requests to “cuddle” with the young girl to establish “an emotional connection” and asking for “pretty” or “sexy” pictures. He also initiated discussion about sexual encounters such as masturbation, sexual intercourse and “meeting up.” <br><br> He was sentenced to 12 months’ incarceration less pretrial custody. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found him guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “Given the serious nature of the Member’s actions and his criminal conviction, the Committee finds that, in order to protect the public, and children in particular, as well as to maintain the integrity of the profession, the Member’s certificate must be revoked.” <br><br> ","Member:  James Joseph Lekavy Registration No:  148679 Decision:  Reprimand, Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the Certificate of Qualification and Registration of James Joseph Lekavy, a former teacher with the Kent County Board of Education (now Lambton Kent District School Board), who was convicted of crimes relating to sexual abuse. <br><br> Licensed to teach in June 1969, Lekavy did not attend the hearing on May 3, 2017, nor was his legal counsel present. <br><br> Lekavy repeatedly sexually abused a total of nine students over the course of almost 20 years. <br><br> He was sentenced to two years’ incarceration. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found him guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> He was also directed to appear before the panel immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel echoed the sentiment of the sentencing judge who stated, “[it is] incomprehensible how a teacher charged with the responsibility for young developing boys could take such advantage of these children, engaged in a noble profession that permitted you to have such a tremendous influence over the course of young men’s lives that you would take advantage in this way for your own purpose and that’s reprehensible and it is just so serious … [The victims] looked up to you as a teacher and as a mentor. They wanted to be in your class. They saw this as a positive element in their life and you completely betrayed their trust.” <br><br> The panel added, “The Member’s conduct constituted devastating abuse of young boys who were his students, without regard for how his actions would affect his victims.” <br><br> ","Member:  Magelle Lepage Registration No:  205524 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of Magelle Lepage, a teacher with the Conseil scolaire de district catholique de l’Est ontarien, for engaging in an inappropriate personal relationship with a student. <br><br> This matter was heard by the panel on April 13, 2017. Lepage, who was certified to teach in July 1995, attended the hearing and had legal representation. <br><br> Lepage’s psychological or emotional abuse of the student, which lasted for several months, was not sexual in nature.

She was directed to appear before the panel immediately following the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> It also ordered her to successfully complete, at her own expense and within 120 days of the panel’s order, a course on maintaining appropriate boundaries. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “The course on maintaining appropriate boundaries will assist with the Member’s rehabilitation by reminding her of her obligations as a member of the teaching profession.” <br><br> ","Member:  Anne Lynn Maranda, OCT Registration No:  502387 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Anne Lynn Maranda, a teacher with the Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud, for her involvement in irregular practices related to the development of Individual Education Plans (IEPs). <br><br> Certified to teach in July 2006, Maranda attended the hearing on March 8, 2017, and was represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found her guilty of professional misconduct and directed that she appear before it immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. <br><br> Within 120 days of the decision, Maranda must also successfully complete, at her own expense, a course on professional ethics. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated that it acknowledges that the member was obeying her supervisors’ instructions, that she made an effort to meet with her supervisors to discuss the irregular practice that she observed vis-à-vis the IEPs (a meeting that never took place) and that she was remorseful. <br><br> ","Member:  Phillip Ian Nolan Registration No:  262789 Decision:  Reprimand, Revocation <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of Phillip Ian Nolan, a former teacher with the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, for repeatedly sexually abusing two students. <br><br> He pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual interference, in a criminal court, and was sentenced to two years in jail and three years of probation. <br><br> The trial judge said, “Mr. Nolan was a teacher; he was entrusted to educate, guide and inspire children. We, as parents and as a community, believe that our children are safe at school. We trust and we must trust the system. It is not a place where one of a parent’s worse nightmares is to become a reality. Yet, that is what occurred in this case. Mr. Nolan breached the trust.” <br><br> Certified to teach in June 1994, Nolan did not attend the Discipline Committee panel’s hearing on March 30, 2017, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> The panel found Nolan guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> It also ordered him to receive a written reprimand. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, “Through his reprehensible conduct, the Member has forfeited the privilege of holding a teaching certificate in Ontario.” <br><br> ","Member:  Robert Brooklyn Roe, OCT Registration No:  526372 Decision:  Reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel reprimanded Robert Brooklyn Roe, a teacher with the Toronto District School Board, for making inappropriate comments to students and failing to maintain appropriate professional boundaries. <br><br> The member, who was certified to teach in June 2008, attended the public hearing on June 2, 2017, with his legal counsel. <br><br> The panel heard that Roe’s conduct included comments and actions that crossed professional boundaries and made students feel uncomfortable. <br><br> It found Roe guilty of professional misconduct and ordered him to appear before it immediately after the hearing to receive a reprimand. The panel also directed the member to successfully complete, at his own expense, a pre-approved course on appropriate boundaries with students. He needs to do so within 90 days of the date of the order. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, “The coursework will remind the Member of his obligations as a teacher and will help him to make better decisions in any future interactions with students.” <br><br> ","Member:  Zubair Ahmed Shaikh Registration No:  429630 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of College member Zubair Ahmed Shaikh for making a series of inappropriate comments with a sexual undertone to a female student while they were alone in his office. <br><br> His conduct had a profound negative impact on the student’s high school career. <br><br> Shaikh, who was certified to teach in August 1999, attended the hearing on January 28–29, 2016, February 11–12, 2016, March 29, 2016, and May 1, 2017. He had legal representation. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found him guilty of professional misconduct. <br><br> The panel ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for six months and that he appear before it, immediately following the hearing, to receive a reprimand. <br><br> In addition, Shaikh was directed to complete, at his own expense, a course on maintaining professional boundaries. He was directed to do so within 90 days after the date of the order. <br><br> In its written decision, the panel stated, “It is wholly unacceptable for members of the teaching profession to make insensitive, demeaning and unprofessional comments to students.” <br><br> ","Member:  Kenneth Gavin Bernard Williamson Registration No:  150105 Decision:  Revocation, Fine, Costs <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel revoked the certificate of College member Kenneth Gavin Bernard Williamson for engaging in repeated violent sexual abuse of a child. <br><br> Williamson sexually exploited a boy repeatedly over a long period of time. He gained access to him through a program meant to help vulnerable youth. Certified to teach in June 1980, Williamson did not attend the hearing on December 5, 2016, nor was he represented by legal counsel. <br><br> Williamson was convicted of buggery, indecent assault and gross indecency. He was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. The criminal charges were ultimately stayed due to an unreasonable delay in the courts. The Court of Appeal did not overturn the factual findings made by the trial judge or the fact that a jury had found Williamson guilty. The Supreme Court of Canada only dealt with the issue of unreasonable delay and did not consider the factual findings made by the trial judge. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found Williamson guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his Certificate of Qualification and Registration be revoked. <br><br> It also imposed a $5,000 fine and costs of $10,839. <br><br> The panel imposed the fine for a number of reasons. It found that the member’s conduct was one of the worst violations a person in a position of trust could commit upon a child. Williamson showed no remorse for his conduct during his criminal trial, did not acknowledge the tremendous damage his abuse had inflicted upon the victim, and did not participate in the College proceeding. <br><br> The panel found the costs were warranted given Williamson’s rationale for failing to participate in these proceedings — namely that he was financially secure and did not plan to teach again and, therefore, did not need to engage in the College’s processes. <br><br> By failing to communicate or engage in discussions with the College, Williamson required the College to incur the full costs of a contested hearing, which placed significant emotional burden upon the witness in this case. <br><br> In its decision, the panel stated, “The Member abused a vulnerable child who saw him as a father figure. The Member has preyed on a child for his own sexual gratification, and he should never again have the privilege of being certified as a teacher in Ontario.” <br><br> The panel added that the sustained sexual abuse had a significant detrimental effect on the victim’s mental health and his quality of life. The abuse damaged him psychologically and caused him lifelong pain. ","Member:  Raymond Nicholas Allam Registration No:  475667 Decision:  Suspension, reprimand, conditions <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel suspended the certificate of Raymond Nicholas Allam, a teacher formerly employed by the Rainy River District School Board, for inappropriate conduct. <br><br> Allam engaged in several incidents of inappropriate and non-consensual grabbing or attempted grabbing of his colleagues’ genitals.

Allam, who was certified to teach in June 2004, attended the hearing remotely via video conference. He had legal representation. <br><br> The Discipline Committee panel found him guilty of professional misconduct and ordered that his teaching certificate be suspended for three months. <br><br> He was directed to appear before the panel to receive a reprimand. <br><br> It also ordered him to successfully complete, at his own expense, a course on professional interactions and boundary violations.

<p>I decided to make the urls from a couple of small functions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Function to loop through years
ps_year &lt;- function(start.year, end.year) {
        yr &lt;- list()
        n &lt;- 1
        for (i in start.year:end.year) {
                yr[n:(n + 3)] &lt;- rep(i, 4)
                n &lt;- n + 4
                
        }
        return(yr)
}

# Function to loop through months
ps_month &lt;- function() {

<h4>How to clean the data</h4>
<p>Ok good. It worked. Let’s clean it up some by removing that first paragraph, and segregating it by case rather than by line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url.data.clean &lt;- list()

for (i in 1:length(url.data)) {
        url.data.clean[i] &lt;- list(i = url.data[[i]][-1])

<p>And now, let’s put everything in a data frame instead of working with lists, because I’m not as familiar with lists…</p>

Member: C. Robert Clements Registration No: 266425Decision: Revoked <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered the Registrar to revoke the certificate of C. Robert Clements for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old male. <br><br> Clements, who joined the teaching profession in June 1964, did not attend the August 25, 2011 hearing and was not represented. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, in January 2009, Clements invited the boy to his home where he fondled the boy. Subsequently, Clements was found guilty of sexual assault in criminal court and sentenced to 12 months probation. As well, he was ordered not to contact the boy or his family, not to be in the presence of anyone under 16 except with the child’s parent(s) present, not to possess any weapons for 10 years and to attend treatment and counselling. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member engaged in inappropriate and unprofessional conduct with the student while that student was under his care and supervision,” the panel said. “The member’s conduct is disgraceful and unbecoming a member of the profession. Revocation is the appropriate penalty for misconduct of this severity and protects the public interest.” <br><br>

Member: C. Robert Clements Registration No: 266425 Decision: Revoked <br><br> A Discipline Committee panel ordered the Registrar to revoke the certificate of C. Robert Clements for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old male. <br><br> Clements, who joined the teaching profession in June 1964, did not attend the August 25, 2011 hearing and was not represented. <br><br> The panel heard evidence that, in January 2009, Clements invited the boy to his home where he fondled the boy. Subsequently, Clements was found guilty of sexual assault in criminal court and sentenced to 12 months probation. As well, he was ordered not to contact the boy or his family, not to be in the presence of anyone under 16 except with the child’s parent(s) present, not to possess any weapons for 10 years and to attend treatment and counselling. <br><br> Having considered the evidence, the Discipline Committee panel found the member guilty of professional misconduct and directed the Registrar to revoke his Certificate of Qualification and Registration. <br><br> “The member engaged in inappropriate and unprofessional conduct with the student while that student was under his care and supervision,” the panel said. “The member’s conduct is disgraceful and unbecoming a member of the profession. Revocation is the appropriate penalty for misconduct of this severity and protects the public interest.” <br><br>
