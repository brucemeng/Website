A couple of years back there was a news article written about someone that I went to high school with. We were in the same grade and we shared many classes together, including some extra-curricular classes like band class. We were never that close, and we never stayed in contact after high school, but nonetheless I recognized the name and picture when I saw it.

It turns out that he made the news because he was charged with "sexual exploitation" of a student of his while he was a teacher at a high school that was about 10 min away from where I now live. I recently just drove by that high school, and that prompted me to look into that case and whether he was found guilty or not (he was).

While exploring the internet for the results of his hearing, I found that the Toronto District School Board has a website that lists all offenses from presumably all teachers, going as far back as 2012 or so. It piqued my interest to explore this dataset a bit more fully than to simply look up a past classmate's fate.

## Observations

![](/img/teachers/gender.plot.png)

1. First thing that jumped out at me was male teachers represent more than 2x the number of female teachers. I don't have a gender split of the total number of teachers available, but going by my own anecdotal experience, female teachers likely outnumber male teachers. So the fact that male teachers dominate misconduct hearings is even more significant.

## Appendix
### 1. Obtaining and cleaning the data

#### How to scrape the data

The data from the "Professionally Speaking" website is split by month across many years. 

![Professionally Speaking Website](/img/teachers/ps.website.PNG)

I decided to make the urls from a couple of small functions:

```{r get.url, echo = T}
# Function to loop through years
ps_year <- function(start.year, end.year) {
        yr <- list()
        n <- 1
        for (i in start.year:end.year) {
                yr[n:(n + 3)] <- rep(i, 4)
                n <- n + 4
                
        }
        return(yr)
}

# Function to loop through months
ps_month <- function() {
        mon <- c("March", "June", "September", "December")
        return(mon)

}

# Function to build professionally speaking URL
ps_url <- function(start.year, end.year) {
        url <- paste0("http://professionallyspeaking.oct.ca/hearings/hearings-",
                      ps_year(start.year, end.year), "-",
                      ps_month(), ".aspx")
        return(url)
        
}

```

With our functions made, we can now scrape all of the available "Hearings" data:

```{r get.data}
start.date <- 2012
end.date <- 2018

url <- ps_url(start.date, end.date)
# Use possibly to process urls not yet available
read_url_possibly <- possibly(read_html, otherwise = NULL)
nodes_possibly <- possibly(html_nodes, otherwise = NULL)
text_possibly <- possibly(html_text, otherwise = NULL)

url.data <- url %>%
        map(read_url_possibly) %>%
        map(nodes_possibly, "p") %>%
        map(text_possibly)
        
# View results
head(url.data[[1]], 2)

```

#### How to clean the data

Ok good. It worked. Let's clean it up some by removing that first paragraph, and segregating it by case rather than by line:

```{r clean.data}
url.data.clean <- list()

# Remove preamble
for (i in 1:length(url.data)) {
        url.data.clean[i] <- list(i = url.data[[i]][-1])
        
}

# Separate by case, instead of by sentence/line
url.data.clean <- url.data.clean %>%
        map(paste, collapse = " <br><br> ") %>%
        textclean::replace_white() %>%
        map(strsplit, split = "(?<=.)(?=Member: )", perl = TRUE)

# Label list by year-month
names(url.data.clean) <- paste(ps_year(start.date, end.date), 
                               ps_month(),"",
                               sep = "_")



```

And now, let's put everything in a data frame instead of working with lists, because I'm not as familiar with lists...

```{r data.frame}
# Establish number of entries
n <- url.data.clean %>%
        unlist() %>%
        length()

# Skeleton data frame
url.data.df <- tibble(id = rep(NA, n),
                      name = NA,
                      gender = NA,
                      text = NA)

# Label date
url.data.df$id <- url.data.clean %>%
        unlist() %>%
        names()

# Extract year
url.data.df$year <- url.data.df$id %>%
        str_extract("20[0-9]+")

# Extract month
url.data.df$month <- url.data.df$id %>%
        str_extract("[A-Za-z]+")

# Place full text into `text` column
url.data.df$text <- url.data.clean %>%
        map(1) %>%
        unlist() %>%
        textclean::replace_white()

```

Let's take a look to see what our data frame looks like right now:

```{r view.data, echo = F}
kable(url.data.df %>% head(1), "html", escape = F) %>%
    kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"),
                      font_size = 10)

```

Perfect. That's exactly what we are looking for (namely a structured view of the unstructured entries in Professionally Speaking).

Let's continue our processing steps to extract the name of the teacher:

```{r name}
## Extract name
# First, we need to add spaces so all words are separated by a space
url.data.df$text <- url.data.df$text %>%
        map(str_replace_all, "([0-9a-zA-Z])([D|R])", "\\1 \\2")

# Next, we add a [space] after ":"
url.data.df$text <- url.data.df$text %>%
        map(str_replace_all, "([:])(.)", "\\1 \\2")


# Looking for all words after "Member: " and before "Registration|Decision"
url.data.df$name <- url.data.df$text %>%
        str_extract("(?s)(?<=Member: )(.*?)(?= (Reg|Dec))") %>%
        textclean::replace_white()

```

```{r view.data2, echo = F}
kable(url.data.df %>% head(1), "html", escape = F) %>%
    kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"),
                      font_size = 10)

```

Let's now extract the "Decision":

```{r decision}
## Extract Decision
# Looking for all words after "Decision: " and before "A panel/etc."
url.data.df$decision <- url.data.df$text %>%
        str_extract("(?s)(?<=Decision: )(.*?)(?= <br>)")

```

```{r view.data3, echo = F}
kable(url.data.df %>% head(1), "html", escape = F) %>%
    kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"),
                      font_size = 10)

```

Let's find the gender of the teacher:

```{r gender}
# If "he" is mentioned than gender = male, otherwise gender = female
is_male <- function(txt) {
        tok <- tokenizers::tokenize_words(txt) %>%
                unlist()
        sum.he <- sum(tok == "he" | tok == "him" | tok == "himself")
        sum.she <- sum(tok == "she" | tok == "her" | tok == "herself")
        
        if (sum.he > sum.she) {
                return("male")
        } else {
                return("female")
        }

}

url.data.df$gender <- url.data.df$text %>%
        map(is_male)

```

### 2. Full table

```{r table, echo = F}
# url.data.df %>%
#         select(name, gender, year, month, decision, text) %>%
#         kable("html", escape = F) %>%
#         kable_styling(c("striped", "hover"),
#                       font_size = 10) %>%
#         column_spec(1, bold = T, width = "2%") %>%
#         column_spec(2:5, width = "2%")

url.data.df %>%
        select(name, gender, year, month, decision, text) %>%
        DT::datatable(
                escape = F,
                style = "bootstrap",
                rownames = F,
                options = list(
                        columnDefs = list(list(width = "100em", targets = 5)),
                        lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 20),
                        autoWidth = F
                )
        ) %>%
        DT::formatStyle(columns = 1:6, "vertical-align" = "top") %>%
        DT::formatStyle(columns = 1:6, fontSize = "10px") %>%
        DT::formatStyle(columns = 1, fontWeight = "bold")
        
```
