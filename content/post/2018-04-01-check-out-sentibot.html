<p>Iâ€™ve been reading reddit for a while now, and Iâ€™ve noticed that reddit has a lot of really funny and really useful bots!</p>
<p>The most impressive bot that Iâ€™ve encountered is AutoTLDR. It will automatically reduce long articles by at least 70% and I found that the quality of the summaries it creates is often times indistinguishable from a human summary. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/">Hereâ€™s a link to the AutoTLDR FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>AutoTLDR inspired me to try creating something that resembles a bot tooâ€¦ and so SentiBot is born in the Projects section!</p>
<div id="sentibot" class="section level1">
<h1>SentiBot</h1>
<p>SentiBot was created so I (and you) can access this custom trained sentiment analysis algorithm I created at work to read and assess this particular business report that most of the folks at BMO read.</p>
<p>Previously, the sentiment algorithm would only run on the report and would only read the report. Now, the sentiment algorithm can be interactively accessed through SentiBot.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not sure how well it will assess on all Internet sentences since it was trained to specifically read one type of report, but Iâ€™ve been having fun subjecting it to all sorts of weird and wacky sentences ðŸ˜„.</p>
<p>Please feel free to try out <a href="URL">SentiBot</a> yourself and let me know of how well (or not well!) it works for you!</p>
