<p>Iâ€™ve been reading reddit for a while now, and Iâ€™ve noticed that reddit has a lot of really funny and really useful bots!</p>
<p>The most impressive bot that Iâ€™ve encountered is <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/">AutoTLDR</a></strong>. It will automatically reduce long articles by at least 70% and I found that the quality of the summaries it creates is often times indistinguishable from a human summary.</p>
<p>AutoTLDR inspired me to try to create something that resembles a bot tooâ€¦ and so SNTI2-D2 is born in the Projects section! (In case you missed itâ€¦ SNTI2-D2 is my very subtle play on the most famous droid of all time: R2-D2).</p>

<h1>SNTI2-D2 Droid</h1>
<p>SNTI2-D2 was created so I (and you) can access a specific custom trained sentiment analysis algorithm I created at work to read and assess this particular business report that quite a few people at BMO read.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not sure how well it will assess all Internet sentences since it was trained to specifically read one type of report, but Iâ€™ve been having fun subjecting it to all sorts of weird and wacky sentences ðŸ˜„.</p>
<p>Please feel free to try out <strong><a href="https://www.brucemeng.ca/project/snti2-d2/">SNTI2-D2</a></strong> yourself and let me know of how well (or not well!) it works for you!</p>
