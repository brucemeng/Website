Hi!

My name is Bruce.

I am currently employed with BMO Financial Group, one of the largest banks in Canada.

I have concentrated my studies around economics, accounting, and finance while at the University of Toronto and have managed to also obtain an accounting designation. My current focus is on integrating various data science concepts into classical financial analysis and modelling. 

I intend to use this website as a medium to collect, write, and share my adventures in data science.

I am an avid R user, and also like to cycle when the sun is out `r emo::ji("smile")`.

If you enjoyed my site, check out David Robinson's excellent posts at [Variance Explained](http://varianceexplained.org/), and also the broader R community as well at [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).
